It's Charlie Morgan, and welcome to another video for the YouTube channel. So I've got a really exciting one for you today.\n\nI've interviewed Ketu Lenifer, one of our wonderful clients. Ketu started with us five months ago. When he started with us, he was basically a glorified freelancer.\n\nThat's a term that I like to use to describe someone who has done a nine ninety seven agency course, that's failed them. Right? They do everything in their agency. There's chaos.\n\nThey hardly book any meetings. They hardly get any clients. Their service delivery is kinda screwed up. They've got no systems for onboarding, no team, no processes.\n\nIt's just chaos, basically.\n\nAnd we've helped Ketu go from that point to the point now where he's a six some well, almost even a multi six figure agency owner. Last month, he made fifteen thousand dollars, and that's a trend that sort of continued over the last couple of months. And he's basically gone from two grand a month to fifteen grand a month in five months, which is insane. Right? That sort of transformation is not easy to do, and and we've done that for him, but obviously quite a few other people at this point as well. And today's video is just to explore his transformation, for him to sort of give you guys some advice on how he's done it and just some pointers and everything like that. And he's not done this is the cool thing he's probably going to be at thirty ks a month in the next like four months I'd expect, so when he hits that we'll probably reinterview him and and just sort of go back through that process.\n\nBut yeah the other thing I wanted to note about this video is that for some reason Zoom didn't record me and him. So so usually when you record on Zoom, obviously, it flips between who's talking as to who's actually on the recording, but it didn't. It's just his him, basically. So he's probably gonna hate me for that. Sorry, Ketu.\n\nBut, yeah, he's, he should be okay with it. But for some reason, it didn't record me. It just recorded him. But, yeah, that's everything from me. Awesome transformation from Ketu. He he talks about, like, what he's found useful about the program and other parts of the stuff we've been working with him on, and I could not be happier for him. It fills me with so much joy and warmth to just help people do this.\n\nAnd if you're also curious as to how we could help you do this and go from a couple grand a month to six figures or multi six figures. And by and the the the thing about this, right, and one caveat is that there's a lot of people out there that say they can do this, and there's a lot of people out there who say they can get you to ten k a month or fifty k a month or one hundred k a month, but very few actually have tangible evidence that they can actually do it. Very few people have interviews with clients that actually explain the process and have testimonials and case studies. Very easy to say, oh, I can get you to ten k a month, I can get you to fifty k a month, But to see that there's actual human beings that have achieved this goal, I thought it might be helpful for you to see because it might give you some inspiration.\n\nSo, yeah, that's everything. For me, just a quick warning that it is only Ketu on the recording. I'm fine with that. He's a lovely boy, lovely man, actually.\n\nI think he's, like, twenty one.\n\nLike, I think he's twenty one. Late teens, early twenties. That's for sure.\n\nBut, yeah, guys, hope you enjoy it, and I'll talk to you in the next video. Cheers.\n\nAlright then. Hey, everybody. How's it going? It's Charlie Morgan, and welcome to another video. Today, I've got a wonderful client of ours, Ketu, who joined us in earlier this year. I don't know specifically, but it's been, like, five months or something. Right?\n\nYeah. About five months now.\n\nFive months ago. Kheti's been working with us for five months. And in that time, he scaled his agency from three k a month to fifteen k a month. Now this is pretty awesome, and it's quite common in this typical result we help clients get. The main theme transformation that we see here is helping people like you, Kathu, go from glorified freelancer to actual, like, six or multi six figure agency owner.\n\nSo we're gonna sort of explore that transformation and and how we help to achieve it. But before I jump into everything, do you wanna sort of explain a bit about who you are and your agency and just introduce yourself?\n\nAbsolutely. Yep. So, I'm Ketu, after the lovely introduction from Charlie.\n\nYeah. And, so I started my agency in about twenty twenty twenty, and, yeah, I think I followed the traditional route like everybody did.\n\nThey follow somebody, and then they pick up a call. Like, you call it a nine nine seven course.\n\nAnd and, yeah, you get started in that journey. You start scaling. But, yeah. So I started that in twenty twenty.\n\nIt's just been a year now that I've had my agency. Mhmm. And, yeah, I'd say that I I really just ran into a rut. I saw some success, but I just ran into a rush because, I think it was genuinely just other peep more people are starting agencies, more competition or, whatever.\n\nBut I just saw that it's significantly harder to book appointments and meetings. And in this game that we play that if you don't if you're not booking appointments and meetings, you're going hungry. You know what I mean? Like, you're not gonna have a good situation.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo, before joining the the program, before Charlie reached out to me, I was probably getting a meeting a month. Yeah. If I'm honest answer, that was probably a meeting or two meetings a month. But, yeah, it was it was just a really bad situation. And at the time, I was actually looking for, like, a done for you service where, I thought I I thought I had, like, a good system.\n\nYeah.\n\nI thought I had, like, a good system. I'm like, you know what? I just need to pump more volume into this system that I thought that I had. And, when you reached out to me, I I was like, I I feel disappointed when we when we hopped into the call for the first time because I was like, oh, this is not a doubt for you.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut, yeah, like, obviously, it's one of the best things that ever happened, to be honest with you, because you did explain what you and Beau did. And, I'll I'll never forget that call. I was extremely nervous, man. I I was Yeah.\n\nIt was I I remember it really explicitly.\n\nI do for most of the calls that we have people sign up, which is kinda crazy.\n\nBut I remember how how much sort of just over the fence pushing. It took. Yeah. You were like, oh, man.\n\nI'm so scared. I'm so nervous. I was like, look, man. We we got you.\n\nLike, this is Yeah.\n\nBecause at at the time, that was my entire paycheck.\n\nI was like Yeah.\n\nAm I crazy, like, for quite an entire paycheck and, see if this is gonna work, and it did. And, you know, fast forward, I jumped in. And, just because of, like, how serious I was and not that I really did invest my entire paycheck. Yeah.\n\nI went jumped in immediately, and I didn't waste no time. I think you I got access on, like, a Saturday even. Jumped in, like, went over, like, the massive amount of content that was in there and, picked something that looked very I wanna I wasn't very religious when it came to following it it systematically and, like, in sequence, but I picked up something that seemed very cool because it it was something called a ghost bus sequence. Mhmm.\n\nObviously, if you're in the program, you'll know what that is and the workflows.\n\nAnd I was like, you know, that's pretty cool because Just to give some context, so that that we we have this video in the program called ghostbuster workflows.\n\nAnd these are basically templates that we use to stop people from ghosting us. So, like, everyone's got this one prospect that that they've had on their books that that there's never booked a call with them or who hasn't showed up. And so we have sequences to nurture those and get them on the call. But do you wanna, yeah, carry on with the because I'm I know where you're going with this.\n\nIt's It's an amazing workflow. Yeah. And, yeah, obviously, the name was, like, the headline for me. I was like, oh, that's amazing because I have, like, so many people that are just, like, ghosted, you know, whatever that have left me.\n\nMhmm.\n\nAnd, we had conversations that just went to yeah. They just didn't really go anywhere. And then, implemented that immediately, without even, like, creating my Loom, checking my deliverability, everything. I just jumped in, and I was like, let me start this.\n\nAnd then, yeah, I think I signed my first client using those workflows a week into the program. Jeez. And then I was like, oh, this is awesome. And then, when I actually went through the entire program, I just kept like, I I implemented religiously.\n\nYeah. I worked on, and then I was just signing up front and center. Like, between my entire duration is five months now. I signed about nine, ten.\n\nWell, nine because one client had two companies that they trusted us with. So Technically. I wanna call that ten. Yeah.\n\nSo, yeah, we get paid from both companies separately since ten. Mhmm.\n\nSo, yeah, I was just, like, repeating the process. I was like, oh, this works. This works. This works. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again.\n\nI think I'm not too excited because I'm I'm still that, like, client capacity right now, and I actually need to, like, potentially upload some to make room for more higher ticket ones.\n\nThis is what I wanted to explore because I think you got about two or three months in and you hit your own personal capacity. Because this is you you were like, shit. What do I do? We were like, need immediate volume.\n\nSo I think you had one, but you didn't outsource it in in full or something like that.\n\nMhmm. And that was awesome. So you started with us beforehand. You were struggling. You're booking, like, a meeting or two a month, signing, like, a client every, like, three months or something. And how long had you been so that was since twenty twenty.\n\nSo, like, twelve months you've been going through that.\n\nIt was about twelve months. Twenty twenty, I started my agency in February. I only landed my first client in September. And then, I think, yeah, I joined on with you five months ago. I think that was August, if I'm not mistaken. I'm not sure.\n\nNo. And you just did, like, fifteen k a month, which is that's insane to think, man. I started at three.\n\nIt's now Oh, is that, like, three or two even?\n\nThree is quite generous.\n\nI I was like, yeah. I probably started at, like, two. I actually couldn't afford the full course, so I had to, like, break it up into, like, yeah, luckily, they were very accommodating.\n\nYeah.\n\nI remember it, man. So now that you've now that you've been through knowing what you know now and looking back at the program, what what do you feel is the thing that's had the most impact, for, like, the key one or two key lessons that you've learned working with us and things that you think, fuck, I can actually attribute my success to. Not not just that. Obviously, it's a lot of it's to do with your hard work.\n\nBut Yeah. What are the main lessons you think you've learned?\n\nSo I I genuinely think it was, in terms of, like, obviously, you guys the course is full spectrum in terms of between service delivery and client acquisition. But for me, Loom alchemy was the was the sole contributor towards my success. Mhmm. And, obviously, for those who don't know what Loom Alchemy is is that, obviously, we we acquire clients through sending looms. But it was just the systems and the ways we do it.\n\nBut, Jesus, that was probably the sole contributor because I didn't know what to do at some point. I had a meeting almost every day, and I was not used to that. I was like yeah. Because when I was joining, I was like, oh, shit.\n\nI have this works. It has to work. Yeah. And then, yeah, I did it for, like, yeah, a couple of months, and I was like, this system is is working.\n\nI haven't changed my offer. I'm just all send sending out, the same message, and, now I've actually just scaled back.\n\nMhmm. And you don't have to send much volume to book a meeting a day, do you?\n\nI actually didn't. I actually cheated. Like, that's why I felt like I I I I didn't deserve it because, yeah, you you rec you had us recommended amounts of volume. I was just under that because I was like, wow. That that that is a lot of volume. I'm gonna try and do this because, obviously, I'm on my own at that point. I only have VAs now.\n\nBut, at that point in time, I was like, yo, this is a lot.\n\nBecause I had, like, a client or two or three clients at the time, so I didn't have enough time to do the recommended volume. So I'd say I probably did seventy percent of the recommended volume.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou say only did, ten to fifteen a day then? Just like Yeah.\n\nTen, fifteen a day. But I did I was religious with my follow ups, so that to be fair. But, yeah, my my volume wasn't where it is where it was supposed to be, but I scaled quickly from then. And then when I added more volume, when I added in VAs, that's when things I saw, like, three clients a month at some point. Yeah.\n\nOh, that's a crazy man. And so when when at what point did you hire a VA? Because I think one of the misconceptions a lot of people have is, like, when they look at a program, this is the philosophy that you had before you invested as you were like, I haven't got the time to do this. Like, I'm but then it's like you're making a couple grand a month, but things are so chaotic, and you don't know what to focus on. So when you joined us, at which point did you hire a VA? How quickly in did you do that to outsource the average?\n\nAfter my third client side, that's when I said, okay. Cool.\n\nThat's when I was sort of reaching capacity, and I ran into media buy issues and had to change over. So I knew I had no time, to to do the outreach, and I knew that I was actually on a coaching call. I was like, guys, I'm thinking of, like, stopping the outreach so far. And you guys are like, no ways.\n\nYou gotta keep you gotta you gotta the system is working. You gotta keep pushing it. And then I said, okay. Cool.\n\nThe only way to logically do this is to actually get a VA.\n\nYeah. I think that's a mistake a lot of people make is, like, you know, we we help people find something that works, and then they sign. They get they get, like, five clients. They're like, oh my god.\n\nI've, like, tripled my income in the last, like, two months. I'll stop doing outreach. And it's like, no. Like, you don't stop the thing that feeds you.\n\nYou outsource it, if that makes sense. So when when you joined us, we were sort of discussing this before the before the meeting and talking about sort of, like, what sort of impact this has had. Because, obviously, you know, from a fancy YouTube title, like, two to fifteen k a month in five months is pretty mad. But when you think about that money, obviously, when you look past the money, what's that done for you?\n\nWhat sort of impact does that have? Because you live in South Africa. So, you know, things right? Things must be good for you.\n\nYeah. Obviously, the conversion rate's amazing. But, yeah. But, yeah, like I as I was saying before the call, like, it's more about the it's not about the flashiness or the money. It's actually just more about what the money's allowed you to do.\n\nAnd, that was for me for my family. That's when I that's why I started the agency, is to take care of my family for good. So, yeah, literally, we had a conversation. We said, look. You you're probably still in the same room, that that you were when you when you when you hopped in. I was like, yes. Because to be honest, you have a lot of the profits is going towards taking care of my family.\n\nThey don't really need to worry about bills anymore.\n\nOh, my god.\n\nThat's just been a that's just been a beautiful thing to to to to witness. And, yeah, you guys were a huge contributor towards that. So thanks.\n\nOh, man. That's incredible. Like, it feels so good because, obviously, like, you know, we do this this is the sort of sales stuff that we teach as well, and you'll be familiar with this. Is it's like you talk about how much money someone wants to make, but then actually understanding why they want to do that and connecting with that reason is so much more, like, valuable at least from from my perspective, and it means so much more. And so when you when you look at your agency and what's next?\n\nLike, on your what's on your sort of What's next?\n\nDo plan. Yeah.\n\nOn my to do list is to actually get rid of some clients. Like, I like I told you, I kept pressing that go go go button sign sign sign sign button, but now it's about getting the higher ticket ones.\n\nMhmm.\n\nSo, now I'm gonna be up to charge more for the services because, a lot goes into it, and I think I was that was a huge, fear or something else holding me back because I didn't believe that I could charge more. And now I've kinda broken past that and actually believe that I can charge more. So, that's that's the goal now is just to find clients, high ticket clients, charge more, provide more value. And then, with the lower ticket clients, kind of phase them off in the, like, obviously, not the in a malicious way.\n\nIt's just to you know, we've we've got a goal to reach. And, the way to get there is with, not necessarily more smaller ticket clients, but maybe fewer high ticket clients is what I've thought. So, yeah, we're setting up rooms again and, people booking in meetings, trying to find good fits. And, yeah, for me now, I've actually, like, for one set before, like, I used to say, I just sign, sign, sign, sign because it worked.\n\nNow I'm like, if it's actually not a good fit, now I can actually have the authority and the power and the confidence to say, no. This is actually not going to work.\n\nYeah. That's an incredible position to be in on a sales call. It's to operate out of abundance, not scarcity. And And then you're you're on and it removes all the pressure from the call as well.\n\nAbsolutely. Yeah. I'm going to chill.\n\nI'm like closes or not.\n\nYou're just like Yeah.\n\nI'm like, genuinely. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. I'm like, genuinely, I I this if whether this goes right or goes wrong, I'm happy.\n\nI'm I'm I'm okay. And I'm not very outcome dependent, but that's more about, like, really important importance of finding a good fit because I have signed those bad fits where you actually you witness an experience, that it's actually not good for you. But, obviously, I I tend to learn things the harder way.\n\nAnd that that sticks to me. It always sticks to me because you you you say this before. You, like, you you pretty much warn us beforehand, but, I don't know. That's just the type of learner I am. I'm like, oh, okay. Maybe past experiences Yeah. I think are actually the best teachers.\n\nIt's an important lesson. I mean, building an agency is just basically pain. Like, for those first, like, two years, it really doesn't come into anything other than that. And so yeah.\n\nOkay. So you want you're at fifteen k. What's the next goal if you don't mind sharing financially? You wanna double that thirty k a month?\n\nTwenty five k is the next one because then that's, what a quarter north is here in South Africa.\n\nIn in in South Africa. So that's that's that's what that's, like, some real bullshit. You know what I mean?\n\nMy god. That's gonna be insane. Do you think you can do that with the program?\n\nAbsolutely. Without a doubt.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. Some some there's some people in the program absolutely crushing it as well. Like, genuinely, there's guys bigger than I am that are doing absolutely bits. And, obviously, the the goal is there's just to obviously just catch up, and it's more about, like, yeah, just being in the upper echelon.\n\nNo. No. It's no longer about, like, necessity, but not about, like, just honing in the Minecraft. Trying to a good goal of mine as well now is just to enjoy it a lot more.\n\nYeah. I think it's not really about the money. Post obviously, in the beginning, it's just about the money. But then for me, it's actually, building a system, building a building a company, and building something that can sustain me for the future and, really enjoying the process.\n\nThat's what I'm working on right now. It's just been falling in love with the process.\n\nI think that's, like, a huge it's one of the biggest sort of transformations you make psychologically is going from survival mode. Like, only and then you get to the point where you don't need to survive, you can actually thrive. And you recognize, okay. I've got my salary. I'm sorted financially. I'm stable. I'm settled, and I know I've got the skills and the systems to keep this where it is.\n\nMhmm.\n\nNow I've got room to actually go and build things. And that's that's the coolest thing is going from, like, I don't know what you call it, like, desperate survivor to builder.\n\nLike I said Yeah.\n\nIt's like, from desperation to inspiration Yeah. Is, is is is the next thing, and and I think that's just kind of my work. I know it's just like I'm falling in love with the process. I wake up and I love what I do.\n\nObviously, it gets hard. Like, business always like you said, it is pain. But, I'm just yeah. It's just about enjoying the pain now.\n\nSo, we'll wrap this up in one second. But aside from the program, and the video content specifically, when you've been working with us, what what else has been helpful for you?\n\nObviously, the coaching courses is a huge one. Mhmm.\n\nIt's obviously consuming content is one thing, but obviously, especially when it came to, like, tracking metrics and understanding metrics because that's what you guys teach us when it comes to outreach. But, for you for you to actually go on the coaching call, we whip out our Excel sheets and you break it down for us and, say, look. This is where you this is what needs to be done to improve things. That's just that's just that's invaluable.\n\nWe're kind of genuinely We say that in the program is when we introduce the metric tracking system.\n\nAnd we're like, if you have a problem with Loom or cold calling or cold messaging, the first thing we will ask to see of your in your metrics. If you haven't got your metrics, then that's the problem.\n\nThat's the first problem, essentially. Yeah.\n\nIt's it's always the case.\n\nBecause you've been you've been quite religious with those calls as well. We've seen you on there, like, every other week, maybe once or twice a week.\n\nYeah. It only got like, like I said, when it's as soon as I started scaling, like, too many clients, that's when, like, the attendance was low because sometimes clients would schedule check ins I see. Coaching calls. And, obviously, I'm like, client comes first, but I really wanna join this coaching. Yeah.\n\nWell, you know, it's important, but we gave you the opposite problem you had is you didn't have enough clients. Now you've got too many.\n\nActually, there's like, the beautiful thing now is that look. It's just moving on to a different problem now. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah. Exactly, man. Exactly.\n\nLike, look, obviously, it's just amazing that, you know, the the client acquisition is sorted. Like, Jenny said that if anybody is is struggling with client acquisition or doesn't know how to sign clients, this is the best program to do so.\n\nOh, stop it. You appreciate it, man. Cassie. People people think I've, like, paid you to say this or something.\n\nWhen the You play but from South Africa.\n\nWell, we'll we'll we'll close on this point, Katie. So, obviously, when when you joined us, you were quite scared. You were nervous. You were really sort of. And it it feels like I'm talking to a completely different man, completely different case. Like, it's weird, like, the transformation you've had, not only financially, but personally. But to anyone who's anxious to invest in themselves, not only with us, but, you know, with any other potential company, what would you say to them?\n\nI'd say just do it. Absolutely. Like, I remember when we were on the phone call, I think, I I I I when I hopped in, I was like, that's probably this guy's worst sales call or most difficult sales call in the world because I think we spent thirty minutes mulling this over. And, I think he even put pulled the, what's it? Can we go grab a quick cup of coffee that I use now?\n\nYeah. You're like you're like, I wanna think about it.\n\nI was like, alright.\n\nI'll be back in a second. Then you had to say That was absolutely amazing.\n\nI was like the audacity, but I love it. Yeah. And then, but yeah, I was super nervous, but then I knew that look in my head in that transition period, I said, look. If you really wanna take it to the next level, how badly do you want it?\n\nMhmm. It's either you need to move to the next level, and I think you said these words to me. I get out of your comfort zone. And I think, that was when I was like, you know what?\n\nThat's true. I need to get out of my comfort zone. I want things to stay the same. And the money being used, it's not like it's a waste.\n\nIt's for an investment. I genuinely, I must have made that money back now.\n\nThat's the time. You you had a fair return on investment. Yeah.\n\nThat's like it's like, one of the best things ever. And I'm so happy, and, anybody who's nervous or anxious to join the program, I can assure you that it's legit. It's the real deal and, probably one of the best, client acquisition programs, especially in the game right now.\n\nI appreciate it.\n\nIf you wanna change your situation, this is the this is the program to join.\n\nAwesome, man. I'm grateful. Well, listen, man. Thank you for your time. I'm looking forward to helping you get even beyond this. So, you know, the cool thing is it's, like, once you get to, like, six figures, you're like you you're kind of, like, pissed cause you're like, okay. This is cool for, like, a month, and then it's like, what's next?\n\nIn twenty, thirty, forty, fifty k a month is all within reach for you, especially with high ticket clients. And I I think we can get you there quite quickly and quite easily. Absolutely.\n\nI have no doubt. Like, it's been five months. I've already, like, tripled five times.\n\nYeah. Five x times.\n\nAbsolutely amazed. I can't wait until, like, a year in, two years in.\n\nYou know? We'll have to make, like, a yearly interview. It's like, Ketty went from fifteen k to like fifty k a month in a month.\n\nI think we have to do this to get in a year. That's the goal, man. I wanna be your best YouTube, headline ever.\n\nJust Just like constantly, like, month after month. Like, how can't you add an extra twenty k this month for the for the agency?\n\nBut, yeah, man. I've well, we've got we've got quite a few interviews lined up with different people. And, like, I know you're in ecom, but we've got other ecom guys coming on the channel. And it's weird because, like, we started Imperium back in, like, January. Right? So it's we've been going for eleven months.\n\nAnd it does it does take, like, you know, four or five or six months sometimes for people to have these big leaps like you have, for example. And so when we were in, like, you know, we were sort of in, like, May this year, June, when we which is when we signed you.\n\nObviously, we're like, oh, we haven't gotten, like, incredible case studies yet. You know? But but they didn't realize that this sort of stuff takes time.\n\nExactly.\n\nAnd now it's all coming to fruition. So yeah, man. Well, listen. Greatly appreciate your time. For anyone watching, if you want similar results to Ketu, you know, if you feel like you are like a glorified freelancer, you're spinning your wheels, you've taken a questionable nine nine seven course you kind of loathe, and, you're struggling to get meetings, then we could give you, well, like, a ladder to help you get out of that hole that you're in.\n\nVery long ladder too.\n\nYeah. That's a long yeah. That's a pretty good long ladder, depending on how deep you're in. But, yeah, there'll be a link in the description below, to book a call with us if you're open to that.\n\nObviously, we're heading into the Christmas period, so there might not be much availability. I mean, my calendar's fully booked for this week as well. So, like, if you're watching this immediately, then be patient with it because more slots will open up next week. But, Kati, man, it's been an absolute pleasure.\n\nGreatly appreciate your time. And, I'm really happy for you, man. Congratulations.\n\nThanks so much. Thanks to you as well.\n\nAwesome, brother.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/sctf84wjub?autoplay=0&wmode=transparent&wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

It's Charlie Morgan, and welcome to another video for the YouTube channel. So I've got a really exciting one for you today.\n\nI've interviewed Ketu Lenifer, one of our wonderful clients. Ketu started with us five months ago. When he started with us, he was basically a glorified freelancer.\n\nThat's a term that I like to use to describe someone who has done a nine ninety seven agency course, that's failed them. Right? They do everything in their agency. There's chaos.\n\nThey hardly book any meetings. They hardly get any clients. Their service delivery is kinda screwed up. They've got no systems for onboarding, no team, no processes.\n\nIt's just chaos, basically.\n\nAnd we've helped Ketu go from that point to the point now where he's a six some well, almost even a multi six figure agency owner. Last month, he made fifteen thousand dollars, and that's a trend that sort of continued over the last couple of months. And he's basically gone from two grand a month to fifteen grand a month in five months, which is insane. Right? That sort of transformation is not easy to do, and and we've done that for him, but obviously quite a few other people at this point as well. And today's video is just to explore his transformation, for him to sort of give you guys some advice on how he's done it and just some pointers and everything like that. And he's not done this is the cool thing he's probably going to be at thirty ks a month in the next like four months I'd expect, so when he hits that we'll probably reinterview him and and just sort of go back through that process.\n\nBut yeah the other thing I wanted to note about this video is that for some reason Zoom didn't record me and him. So so usually when you record on Zoom, obviously, it flips between who's talking as to who's actually on the recording, but it didn't. It's just his him, basically. So he's probably gonna hate me for that. Sorry, Ketu.\n\nBut, yeah, he's, he should be okay with it. But for some reason, it didn't record me. It just recorded him. But, yeah, that's everything from me. Awesome transformation from Ketu. He he talks about, like, what he's found useful about the program and other parts of the stuff we've been working with him on, and I could not be happier for him. It fills me with so much joy and warmth to just help people do this.\n\nAnd if you're also curious as to how we could help you do this and go from a couple grand a month to six figures or multi six figures. And by and the the the thing about this, right, and one caveat is that there's a lot of people out there that say they can do this, and there's a lot of people out there who say they can get you to ten k a month or fifty k a month or one hundred k a month, but very few actually have tangible evidence that they can actually do it. Very few people have interviews with clients that actually explain the process and have testimonials and case studies. Very easy to say, oh, I can get you to ten k a month, I can get you to fifty k a month, But to see that there's actual human beings that have achieved this goal, I thought it might be helpful for you to see because it might give you some inspiration.\n\nSo, yeah, that's everything. For me, just a quick warning that it is only Ketu on the recording. I'm fine with that. He's a lovely boy, lovely man, actually.\n\nI think he's, like, twenty one.\n\nLike, I think he's twenty one. Late teens, early twenties. That's for sure.\n\nBut, yeah, guys, hope you enjoy it, and I'll talk to you in the next video. Cheers.\n\nAlright then. Hey, everybody. How's it going? It's Charlie Morgan, and welcome to another video. Today, I've got a wonderful client of ours, Ketu, who joined us in earlier this year. I don't know specifically, but it's been, like, five months or something. Right?\n\nYeah. About five months now.\n\nFive months ago. Kheti's been working with us for five months. And in that time, he scaled his agency from three k a month to fifteen k a month. Now this is pretty awesome, and it's quite common in this typical result we help clients get. The main theme transformation that we see here is helping people like you, Kathu, go from glorified freelancer to actual, like, six or multi six figure agency owner.\n\nSo we're gonna sort of explore that transformation and and how we help to achieve it. But before I jump into everything, do you wanna sort of explain a bit about who you are and your agency and just introduce yourself?\n\nAbsolutely. Yep. So, I'm Ketu, after the lovely introduction from Charlie.\n\nYeah. And, so I started my agency in about twenty twenty twenty, and, yeah, I think I followed the traditional route like everybody did.\n\nThey follow somebody, and then they pick up a call. Like, you call it a nine nine seven course.\n\nAnd and, yeah, you get started in that journey. You start scaling. But, yeah. So I started that in twenty twenty.\n\nIt's just been a year now that I've had my agency. Mhmm. And, yeah, I'd say that I I really just ran into a rut. I saw some success, but I just ran into a rush because, I think it was genuinely just other peep more people are starting agencies, more competition or, whatever.\n\nBut I just saw that it's significantly harder to book appointments and meetings. And in this game that we play that if you don't if you're not booking appointments and meetings, you're going hungry. You know what I mean? Like, you're not gonna have a good situation.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo, before joining the the program, before Charlie reached out to me, I was probably getting a meeting a month. Yeah. If I'm honest answer, that was probably a meeting or two meetings a month. But, yeah, it was it was just a really bad situation. And at the time, I was actually looking for, like, a done for you service where, I thought I I thought I had, like, a good system.\n\nYeah.\n\nI thought I had, like, a good system. I'm like, you know what? I just need to pump more volume into this system that I thought that I had. And, when you reached out to me, I I was like, I I feel disappointed when we when we hopped into the call for the first time because I was like, oh, this is not a doubt for you.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut, yeah, like, obviously, it's one of the best things that ever happened, to be honest with you, because you did explain what you and Beau did. And, I'll I'll never forget that call. I was extremely nervous, man. I I was Yeah.\n\nIt was I I remember it really explicitly.\n\nI do for most of the calls that we have people sign up, which is kinda crazy.\n\nBut I remember how how much sort of just over the fence pushing. It took. Yeah. You were like, oh, man.\n\nI'm so scared. I'm so nervous. I was like, look, man. We we got you.\n\nLike, this is Yeah.\n\nBecause at at the time, that was my entire paycheck.\n\nI was like Yeah.\n\nAm I crazy, like, for quite an entire paycheck and, see if this is gonna work, and it did. And, you know, fast forward, I jumped in. And, just because of, like, how serious I was and not that I really did invest my entire paycheck. Yeah.\n\nI went jumped in immediately, and I didn't waste no time. I think you I got access on, like, a Saturday even. Jumped in, like, went over, like, the massive amount of content that was in there and, picked something that looked very I wanna I wasn't very religious when it came to following it it systematically and, like, in sequence, but I picked up something that seemed very cool because it it was something called a ghost bus sequence. Mhmm.\n\nObviously, if you're in the program, you'll know what that is and the workflows.\n\nAnd I was like, you know, that's pretty cool because Just to give some context, so that that we we have this video in the program called ghostbuster workflows.\n\nAnd these are basically templates that we use to stop people from ghosting us. So, like, everyone's got this one prospect that that they've had on their books that that there's never booked a call with them or who hasn't showed up. And so we have sequences to nurture those and get them on the call. But do you wanna, yeah, carry on with the because I'm I know where you're going with this.\n\nIt's It's an amazing workflow. Yeah. And, yeah, obviously, the name was, like, the headline for me. I was like, oh, that's amazing because I have, like, so many people that are just, like, ghosted, you know, whatever that have left me.\n\nMhmm.\n\nAnd, we had conversations that just went to yeah. They just didn't really go anywhere. And then, implemented that immediately, without even, like, creating my Loom, checking my deliverability, everything. I just jumped in, and I was like, let me start this.\n\nAnd then, yeah, I think I signed my first client using those workflows a week into the program. Jeez. And then I was like, oh, this is awesome. And then, when I actually went through the entire program, I just kept like, I I implemented religiously.\n\nYeah. I worked on, and then I was just signing up front and center. Like, between my entire duration is five months now. I signed about nine, ten.\n\nWell, nine because one client had two companies that they trusted us with. So Technically. I wanna call that ten. Yeah.\n\nSo, yeah, we get paid from both companies separately since ten. Mhmm.\n\nSo, yeah, I was just, like, repeating the process. I was like, oh, this works. This works. This works. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again.\n\nI think I'm not too excited because I'm I'm still that, like, client capacity right now, and I actually need to, like, potentially upload some to make room for more higher ticket ones.\n\nThis is what I wanted to explore because I think you got about two or three months in and you hit your own personal capacity. Because this is you you were like, shit. What do I do? We were like, need immediate volume.\n\nSo I think you had one, but you didn't outsource it in in full or something like that.\n\nMhmm. And that was awesome. So you started with us beforehand. You were struggling. You're booking, like, a meeting or two a month, signing, like, a client every, like, three months or something. And how long had you been so that was since twenty twenty.\n\nSo, like, twelve months you've been going through that.\n\nIt was about twelve months. Twenty twenty, I started my agency in February. I only landed my first client in September. And then, I think, yeah, I joined on with you five months ago. I think that was August, if I'm not mistaken. I'm not sure.\n\nNo. And you just did, like, fifteen k a month, which is that's insane to think, man. I started at three.\n\nIt's now Oh, is that, like, three or two even?\n\nThree is quite generous.\n\nI I was like, yeah. I probably started at, like, two. I actually couldn't afford the full course, so I had to, like, break it up into, like, yeah, luckily, they were very accommodating.\n\nYeah.\n\nI remember it, man. So now that you've now that you've been through knowing what you know now and looking back at the program, what what do you feel is the thing that's had the most impact, for, like, the key one or two key lessons that you've learned working with us and things that you think, fuck, I can actually attribute my success to. Not not just that. Obviously, it's a lot of it's to do with your hard work.\n\nBut Yeah. What are the main lessons you think you've learned?\n\nSo I I genuinely think it was, in terms of, like, obviously, you guys the course is full spectrum in terms of between service delivery and client acquisition. But for me, Loom alchemy was the was the sole contributor towards my success. Mhmm. And, obviously, for those who don't know what Loom Alchemy is is that, obviously, we we acquire clients through sending looms. But it was just the systems and the ways we do it.\n\nBut, Jesus, that was probably the sole contributor because I didn't know what to do at some point. I had a meeting almost every day, and I was not used to that. I was like yeah. Because when I was joining, I was like, oh, shit.\n\nI have this works. It has to work. Yeah. And then, yeah, I did it for, like, yeah, a couple of months, and I was like, this system is is working.\n\nI haven't changed my offer. I'm just all send sending out, the same message, and, now I've actually just scaled back.\n\nMhmm. And you don't have to send much volume to book a meeting a day, do you?\n\nI actually didn't. I actually cheated. Like, that's why I felt like I I I I didn't deserve it because, yeah, you you rec you had us recommended amounts of volume. I was just under that because I was like, wow. That that that is a lot of volume. I'm gonna try and do this because, obviously, I'm on my own at that point. I only have VAs now.\n\nBut, at that point in time, I was like, yo, this is a lot.\n\nBecause I had, like, a client or two or three clients at the time, so I didn't have enough time to do the recommended volume. So I'd say I probably did seventy percent of the recommended volume.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou say only did, ten to fifteen a day then? Just like Yeah.\n\nTen, fifteen a day. But I did I was religious with my follow ups, so that to be fair. But, yeah, my my volume wasn't where it is where it was supposed to be, but I scaled quickly from then. And then when I added more volume, when I added in VAs, that's when things I saw, like, three clients a month at some point. Yeah.\n\nOh, that's a crazy man. And so when when at what point did you hire a VA? Because I think one of the misconceptions a lot of people have is, like, when they look at a program, this is the philosophy that you had before you invested as you were like, I haven't got the time to do this. Like, I'm but then it's like you're making a couple grand a month, but things are so chaotic, and you don't know what to focus on. So when you joined us, at which point did you hire a VA? How quickly in did you do that to outsource the average?\n\nAfter my third client side, that's when I said, okay. Cool.\n\nThat's when I was sort of reaching capacity, and I ran into media buy issues and had to change over. So I knew I had no time, to to do the outreach, and I knew that I was actually on a coaching call. I was like, guys, I'm thinking of, like, stopping the outreach so far. And you guys are like, no ways.\n\nYou gotta keep you gotta you gotta the system is working. You gotta keep pushing it. And then I said, okay. Cool.\n\nThe only way to logically do this is to actually get a VA.\n\nYeah. I think that's a mistake a lot of people make is, like, you know, we we help people find something that works, and then they sign. They get they get, like, five clients. They're like, oh my god.\n\nI've, like, tripled my income in the last, like, two months. I'll stop doing outreach. And it's like, no. Like, you don't stop the thing that feeds you.\n\nYou outsource it, if that makes sense. So when when you joined us, we were sort of discussing this before the before the meeting and talking about sort of, like, what sort of impact this has had. Because, obviously, you know, from a fancy YouTube title, like, two to fifteen k a month in five months is pretty mad. But when you think about that money, obviously, when you look past the money, what's that done for you?\n\nWhat sort of impact does that have? Because you live in South Africa. So, you know, things right? Things must be good for you.\n\nYeah. Obviously, the conversion rate's amazing. But, yeah. But, yeah, like I as I was saying before the call, like, it's more about the it's not about the flashiness or the money. It's actually just more about what the money's allowed you to do.\n\nAnd, that was for me for my family. That's when I that's why I started the agency, is to take care of my family for good. So, yeah, literally, we had a conversation. We said, look. You you're probably still in the same room, that that you were when you when you when you hopped in. I was like, yes. Because to be honest, you have a lot of the profits is going towards taking care of my family.\n\nThey don't really need to worry about bills anymore.\n\nOh, my god.\n\nThat's just been a that's just been a beautiful thing to to to to witness. And, yeah, you guys were a huge contributor towards that. So thanks.\n\nOh, man. That's incredible. Like, it feels so good because, obviously, like, you know, we do this this is the sort of sales stuff that we teach as well, and you'll be familiar with this. Is it's like you talk about how much money someone wants to make, but then actually understanding why they want to do that and connecting with that reason is so much more, like, valuable at least from from my perspective, and it means so much more. And so when you when you look at your agency and what's next?\n\nLike, on your what's on your sort of What's next?\n\nDo plan. Yeah.\n\nOn my to do list is to actually get rid of some clients. Like, I like I told you, I kept pressing that go go go button sign sign sign sign button, but now it's about getting the higher ticket ones.\n\nMhmm.\n\nSo, now I'm gonna be up to charge more for the services because, a lot goes into it, and I think I was that was a huge, fear or something else holding me back because I didn't believe that I could charge more. And now I've kinda broken past that and actually believe that I can charge more. So, that's that's the goal now is just to find clients, high ticket clients, charge more, provide more value. And then, with the lower ticket clients, kind of phase them off in the, like, obviously, not the in a malicious way.\n\nIt's just to you know, we've we've got a goal to reach. And, the way to get there is with, not necessarily more smaller ticket clients, but maybe fewer high ticket clients is what I've thought. So, yeah, we're setting up rooms again and, people booking in meetings, trying to find good fits. And, yeah, for me now, I've actually, like, for one set before, like, I used to say, I just sign, sign, sign, sign because it worked.\n\nNow I'm like, if it's actually not a good fit, now I can actually have the authority and the power and the confidence to say, no. This is actually not going to work.\n\nYeah. That's an incredible position to be in on a sales call. It's to operate out of abundance, not scarcity. And And then you're you're on and it removes all the pressure from the call as well.\n\nAbsolutely. Yeah. I'm going to chill.\n\nI'm like closes or not.\n\nYou're just like Yeah.\n\nI'm like, genuinely. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. I'm like, genuinely, I I this if whether this goes right or goes wrong, I'm happy.\n\nI'm I'm I'm okay. And I'm not very outcome dependent, but that's more about, like, really important importance of finding a good fit because I have signed those bad fits where you actually you witness an experience, that it's actually not good for you. But, obviously, I I tend to learn things the harder way.\n\nAnd that that sticks to me. It always sticks to me because you you you say this before. You, like, you you pretty much warn us beforehand, but, I don't know. That's just the type of learner I am. I'm like, oh, okay. Maybe past experiences Yeah. I think are actually the best teachers.\n\nIt's an important lesson. I mean, building an agency is just basically pain. Like, for those first, like, two years, it really doesn't come into anything other than that. And so yeah.\n\nOkay. So you want you're at fifteen k. What's the next goal if you don't mind sharing financially? You wanna double that thirty k a month?\n\nTwenty five k is the next one because then that's, what a quarter north is here in South Africa.\n\nIn in in South Africa. So that's that's that's what that's, like, some real bullshit. You know what I mean?\n\nMy god. That's gonna be insane. Do you think you can do that with the program?\n\nAbsolutely. Without a doubt.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. Some some there's some people in the program absolutely crushing it as well. Like, genuinely, there's guys bigger than I am that are doing absolutely bits. And, obviously, the the goal is there's just to obviously just catch up, and it's more about, like, yeah, just being in the upper echelon.\n\nNo. No. It's no longer about, like, necessity, but not about, like, just honing in the Minecraft. Trying to a good goal of mine as well now is just to enjoy it a lot more.\n\nYeah. I think it's not really about the money. Post obviously, in the beginning, it's just about the money. But then for me, it's actually, building a system, building a building a company, and building something that can sustain me for the future and, really enjoying the process.\n\nThat's what I'm working on right now. It's just been falling in love with the process.\n\nI think that's, like, a huge it's one of the biggest sort of transformations you make psychologically is going from survival mode. Like, only and then you get to the point where you don't need to survive, you can actually thrive. And you recognize, okay. I've got my salary. I'm sorted financially. I'm stable. I'm settled, and I know I've got the skills and the systems to keep this where it is.\n\nMhmm.\n\nNow I've got room to actually go and build things. And that's that's the coolest thing is going from, like, I don't know what you call it, like, desperate survivor to builder.\n\nLike I said Yeah.\n\nIt's like, from desperation to inspiration Yeah. Is, is is is the next thing, and and I think that's just kind of my work. I know it's just like I'm falling in love with the process. I wake up and I love what I do.\n\nObviously, it gets hard. Like, business always like you said, it is pain. But, I'm just yeah. It's just about enjoying the pain now.\n\nSo, we'll wrap this up in one second. But aside from the program, and the video content specifically, when you've been working with us, what what else has been helpful for you?\n\nObviously, the coaching courses is a huge one. Mhmm.\n\nIt's obviously consuming content is one thing, but obviously, especially when it came to, like, tracking metrics and understanding metrics because that's what you guys teach us when it comes to outreach. But, for you for you to actually go on the coaching call, we whip out our Excel sheets and you break it down for us and, say, look. This is where you this is what needs to be done to improve things. That's just that's just that's invaluable.\n\nWe're kind of genuinely We say that in the program is when we introduce the metric tracking system.\n\nAnd we're like, if you have a problem with Loom or cold calling or cold messaging, the first thing we will ask to see of your in your metrics. If you haven't got your metrics, then that's the problem.\n\nThat's the first problem, essentially. Yeah.\n\nIt's it's always the case.\n\nBecause you've been you've been quite religious with those calls as well. We've seen you on there, like, every other week, maybe once or twice a week.\n\nYeah. It only got like, like I said, when it's as soon as I started scaling, like, too many clients, that's when, like, the attendance was low because sometimes clients would schedule check ins I see. Coaching calls. And, obviously, I'm like, client comes first, but I really wanna join this coaching. Yeah.\n\nWell, you know, it's important, but we gave you the opposite problem you had is you didn't have enough clients. Now you've got too many.\n\nActually, there's like, the beautiful thing now is that look. It's just moving on to a different problem now. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah. Exactly, man. Exactly.\n\nLike, look, obviously, it's just amazing that, you know, the the client acquisition is sorted. Like, Jenny said that if anybody is is struggling with client acquisition or doesn't know how to sign clients, this is the best program to do so.\n\nOh, stop it. You appreciate it, man. Cassie. People people think I've, like, paid you to say this or something.\n\nWhen the You play but from South Africa.\n\nWell, we'll we'll we'll close on this point, Katie. So, obviously, when when you joined us, you were quite scared. You were nervous. You were really sort of. And it it feels like I'm talking to a completely different man, completely different case. Like, it's weird, like, the transformation you've had, not only financially, but personally. But to anyone who's anxious to invest in themselves, not only with us, but, you know, with any other potential company, what would you say to them?\n\nI'd say just do it. Absolutely. Like, I remember when we were on the phone call, I think, I I I I when I hopped in, I was like, that's probably this guy's worst sales call or most difficult sales call in the world because I think we spent thirty minutes mulling this over. And, I think he even put pulled the, what's it? Can we go grab a quick cup of coffee that I use now?\n\nYeah. You're like you're like, I wanna think about it.\n\nI was like, alright.\n\nI'll be back in a second. Then you had to say That was absolutely amazing.\n\nI was like the audacity, but I love it. Yeah. And then, but yeah, I was super nervous, but then I knew that look in my head in that transition period, I said, look. If you really wanna take it to the next level, how badly do you want it?\n\nMhmm. It's either you need to move to the next level, and I think you said these words to me. I get out of your comfort zone. And I think, that was when I was like, you know what?\n\nThat's true. I need to get out of my comfort zone. I want things to stay the same. And the money being used, it's not like it's a waste.\n\nIt's for an investment. I genuinely, I must have made that money back now.\n\nThat's the time. You you had a fair return on investment. Yeah.\n\nThat's like it's like, one of the best things ever. And I'm so happy, and, anybody who's nervous or anxious to join the program, I can assure you that it's legit. It's the real deal and, probably one of the best, client acquisition programs, especially in the game right now.\n\nI appreciate it.\n\nIf you wanna change your situation, this is the this is the program to join.\n\nAwesome, man. I'm grateful. Well, listen, man. Thank you for your time. I'm looking forward to helping you get even beyond this. So, you know, the cool thing is it's, like, once you get to, like, six figures, you're like you you're kind of, like, pissed cause you're like, okay. This is cool for, like, a month, and then it's like, what's next?\n\nIn twenty, thirty, forty, fifty k a month is all within reach for you, especially with high ticket clients. And I I think we can get you there quite quickly and quite easily. Absolutely.\n\nI have no doubt. Like, it's been five months. I've already, like, tripled five times.\n\nYeah. Five x times.\n\nAbsolutely amazed. I can't wait until, like, a year in, two years in.\n\nYou know? We'll have to make, like, a yearly interview. It's like, Ketty went from fifteen k to like fifty k a month in a month.\n\nI think we have to do this to get in a year. That's the goal, man. I wanna be your best YouTube, headline ever.\n\nJust Just like constantly, like, month after month. Like, how can't you add an extra twenty k this month for the for the agency?\n\nBut, yeah, man. I've well, we've got we've got quite a few interviews lined up with different people. And, like, I know you're in ecom, but we've got other ecom guys coming on the channel. And it's weird because, like, we started Imperium back in, like, January. Right? So it's we've been going for eleven months.\n\nAnd it does it does take, like, you know, four or five or six months sometimes for people to have these big leaps like you have, for example. And so when we were in, like, you know, we were sort of in, like, May this year, June, when we which is when we signed you.\n\nObviously, we're like, oh, we haven't gotten, like, incredible case studies yet. You know? But but they didn't realize that this sort of stuff takes time.\n\nExactly.\n\nAnd now it's all coming to fruition. So yeah, man. Well, listen. Greatly appreciate your time. For anyone watching, if you want similar results to Ketu, you know, if you feel like you are like a glorified freelancer, you're spinning your wheels, you've taken a questionable nine nine seven course you kind of loathe, and, you're struggling to get meetings, then we could give you, well, like, a ladder to help you get out of that hole that you're in.\n\nVery long ladder too.\n\nYeah. That's a long yeah. That's a pretty good long ladder, depending on how deep you're in. But, yeah, there'll be a link in the description below, to book a call with us if you're open to that.\n\nObviously, we're heading into the Christmas period, so there might not be much availability. I mean, my calendar's fully booked for this week as well. So, like, if you're watching this immediately, then be patient with it because more slots will open up next week. But, Kati, man, it's been an absolute pleasure.\n\nGreatly appreciate your time. And, I'm really happy for you, man. Congratulations.\n\nThanks so much. Thanks to you as well.\n\nAwesome, brother."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}}, {});
