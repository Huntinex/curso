Hi, everybody. It's Charlie Morgan, and welcome to another video for the channel. Today, I'm joined by one of our awesome clients, Kiwani, who I I think I'm pronouncing that properly. Yeah.\n\nYou did it again.\n\nYeah. And, Kiwani has been working with us for it's been about, what, five or six months, I think, now.\n\nIt's been about six or seven because I signed up in, like, May.\n\nSo May.\n\nOkay. So, yeah, since May time earlier this year, it's now November. And, we didn't really hear much from you since you since you signed up. You know, you you came on board to the program.\n\nAnd I know we could see you were working through the modules and everything, but we didn't really have much, much contact. And then it wasn't until I sort of contacted you earlier this month to say how are things going, and you're like, they're they're doing well. And we I wanted to sort of hop on Zoom with you quickly for everybody just so we can discuss, like, how well you are doing and what you've been implementing. But before we do any of that, do you wanna just take a quick second to introduce yourself and sort of explain who you are and a bit about what what it is?\n\nOkay. So, my name is Keewani, and I, you know, I run a marketing business focused with consulting for remodelers. So it's, like, in the construction niche. And, I've been doing it for about probably, like, a year and a half, maybe two years, depending on what date I actually started. And, I came in a in contact with you guys during, like, May.\n\nI think you sent me, like, probably, like, six follow ups. And I was like, oh, hey. Let me let's see who this person is. And then, like, we got on our phone immediately and, you know, we just hit it off from there.\n\nSo That was awesome.\n\nBut can you hear me okay, by the way? Because I haven't got AirPods, and I'm just going through lots of audio. It doesn't sound like clunky or anything, does it? It sounds like No.\n\nNo. You're I I hear you fine. Mhmm.\n\nCool. Cool. So, yeah, you you joined us back in May. Do you wanna sort of, the obviously, people are watching. They'll understand the sort of, title I'm gonna use for the video is how you've added twenty to thirty k in new monthly revenue to your agency over the course of, like, since we started working together. But before we talk about where you are now, have having applied the program and seen those improvements, do you wanna sort of explain what the situation was before you started working with us and talking talking about that?\n\nOkay. So before I started, working with Charlie, I was about doing about ten thousand in just revenue. That wasn't actually profit.\n\nAnd, you know, in hindsight, I can see my main problem was that, first, I wasn't consistent, and I didn't have, like, a straightforward way of, structuring my agency. Like, I was kinda all over the place. And so that's like, I was doing, you know, ten thousand in revenue, but my profit margins were I was like, why am I using all these different softwares and stuff like that? I was, like, all over the place.\n\nIt was ridiculous. And so yeah. And then I came into the program and, like, actually saw how you, like, structure agency and how you do outreach. And, like, first of all, my profit margins have increased.\n\nI was like, why was I paying for, like, seven different softwares for no reason at all? Yeah.\n\nNo. That's awesome. Because I remember when I first spoke to you, you hadn't been through any previous programs or Yeah. Like, mentorship programs because a lot of people get into the agency space and they buy a course and but you you hadn't had any training before.\n\nYeah. So, pretty much, like, how I did you and because I'd never been really in a course, I, like, I only come in or, like, message when I need something that I can't seem to logically overcome myself. So I got in, and I was just, like, watching all of your videos and seeing how you do it, but I wasn't asking any questions in the group. I was just kinda like, if I had a question, I would go back and rewatch the videos to see if you, you know, answered it there, which is why I didn't have much.\n\nBut then I was like, okay. Maybe I should actually go in the group just to get, like, the atmosphere. Because I know a lot of people say, like, hey. Just being around other people who, do the same thing as you can kinda motivate you to do more.\n\nI'm working on that. I'm still a hermit.\n\nSo, like Well, I think it's I think it's good, and that's why, a lot of our other clients are in a similar situation where we don't get many questions.\n\nAnd, you know, for us, no news is good news. Right? We sort of knew you were probably doing quite well because if you weren't, you'd let us know. But, obviously, you know, as you're aware, the videos are quite long.\n\nAnd some of them are very so we've got, you know, two, three hour videos on on everything.\n\nAnd so, like, quite often, more than more often than not, people don't need to ask questions because we're quite thorough with that, which is something that might be quite useful. So you you started applying, one of our outreach systems, the Loom system that we teach, pretty much straight away.\n\nAnd Yeah. Pretty much straight away.\n\nAnd, like, as soon as I started, that was actually my biggest month when I first implemented the thirty thousand dollar a month I had. That was actually the month I, implemented the Loom, and it's because I was, like, sending out emails myself. I wasn't, consistent, and I was sending out a lower volume.\n\nAnd so then when I implemented your Loom system of being able to kinda step away and put VAs at the same place, it's like it blew up of because how were you getting clients before?\n\nSo before is, like I was saying is I actually like, my dad, I have brothers and things that are in the construction industry. So I was literally just I I was telling them, hey, like, you know, I I I work with workers and, you know, in construction, they would, like, send me somebody. And so it wasn't as consistent. Like, I was still sending emails, but I wasn't really getting responses. All my my sales was from, like, you know, getting my dad or somebody to get me somebody.\n\nLike, it was word-of-mouth, to profit margins Yeah.\n\nAs you mentioned.\n\nAnd so you went from ten k with no structure and just chaos to, what, a thirty or forty a month in that month?\n\nYeah. So, yeah, it was like a thirty, k a month for the first month, and then, like, I consistently saw do around twenty to, you know, twenty five thousand. And I'm just kind of trying to nail in, you know, who my, you know, ideal client is, and I'm trying to work through that.\n\nMhmm.\n\nSo there and then there are some, like, real stuff in the course that, like, when I heard it, it really changed my whole perspective of a lot of things too.\n\nWhen I like, you said something in the course about, well, you did a metaphor.\n\nYou did a lot of metaphors, but you're like I did.\n\nI'm very I'm very guilty. Like, we get this a lot where, like, one of the easiest ways for us to explain complex, like, things is just to put it into a metaphor, but you go yeah. Go ahead.\n\nBut you said it was the reason why we have our agency, our business, is to help businesses. And you explained in a metaphor when you're meditating, you know, you hear birds, but you start focusing more on that than just meditating and getting the benefit of it. And it's sad to say I realized that when I started this agency was because, like, you can make money with this. Yeah.\n\nAnd I wasn't focusing or dialing into what's actually gonna help businesses. Like, what can I actually do to help them? Mhmm. And, like, realizing that is kinda changing what am I talking about.\n\nLike, when I send emails, when I'm singing looms, it's like, how am I actually helping them, and how do I convey that message? And you really go into that in the course of, like, you know, like, because strategies are good, but if I don't have the right, like, you know, morals or mindset of why I'm doing this, it kinda seems like, you know, pointless.\n\nYeah. And and just to touch on what you said there just so everybody sort of understands. So one of the the main sort of things that we teach in the program because, obviously, as you're probably aware of the program, we have, like a lot of stuff is strategic, but we also have a lot of sort of perspective based mindset stuff. And it's usually just by looking at it in a different way that everything falls into place.\n\nBut what you were talking about there for everybody's sake is, I've got this meditation headband called Muse, and you can sort of meditate with it and you have your headphones in. And when you meditate nice and clearly and focus on your breath, the the headband and the headphones start playing in these little birds. You can hear these birds. And what I started to do mistakenly was I'd meditate so I could hear those birds because I knew it was a good form of feedback.\n\nBut as soon as you focus on the birds, you're losing the breath, which means you're losing the byproduct you actually want to achieve. And so you focus on the thing that produces the thing you want, which in this case is just adding value to businesses.\n\nSo I'm I'm glad that proved valuable. And so we've we've got probably, like, four or five other organic strategies in the program. Have you tried experiments with those at all?\n\nOr that is actually what, I'm looking at now to try to get it more consistent and, you know, scale it is because, you know, construction is kinda like a traditional industry.\n\nIt doesn't really change as much as it what has it has in the last year. So, like, it seems like cold calling because they pick up their phone. Like, I do voice mail drops like you, you recommend it, and those do work really well. So I'm like, maybe I do need to just call, pick up but, like, you know, cold calling, like, is different from sending emails, so I kinda gotta get over this.\n\nIn you can check out because we've got a section on a phone.\n\nI saw that. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nI'm, like, starting to go through that and, like, I need to just, you know, face it and, like because I'm making it bigger than what it is. I know that. So I'm, like, just get on the phone and, like, actually start talking to them about it. So yeah. So I can have, like, two points.\n\nIt's really easy to be scared. And then you start making phone calls because the script we have for cold calling makes makes it so easy. I don't know how far you've got through the the cold calling module yet, but the sort of opening line we use tends to diffuse any sort of fear or tension you might have, which usually makes it ten times easier. And so when you when you look over the over the since we started in May and the last six to seven months, for example, what would you say is, like, one of the one or two of the most important things that you've learned from the program aside from the focusing thing that matters? Like, what would you say we've taught you that's really helped you get to that ten to thirty k a month?\n\nSo it'd more be, obviously, consistency, but also I feel like once I started making money, I didn't I didn't look at how to, scale or take a step back myself. Like, I was still sending all the things and emails myself, and it was like, I'm only one person. I can only do so much in the day. And no matter what I say, like, I know how to send emails and stuff like that, but I'm not the best. Like, there are VAEs out there that can send, like, a hundred in, like, you know, in a short time span. It's like, I know there's people better than me, so why am I, like, focusing on trying to do everything myself?\n\nMhmm.\n\nAnd, like, once I, like, took a step back and was able to look at my business, it's like, I'm doing, what is it, like, twenty around, like, eighteen to twenty thousand in profit now. Like, that's not just revenue. And it's like, I was doing I was doing just ten thousand in revenue. Like so it's like that's like a totally different, ballgame.\n\nAnd so I'm, like, trying to Manage it.\n\nEssentially, like you say in your in your we talked about it even last time. You said there's multiple steps in the agency. Like, if I can literally show you my screen, I literally have the steps you put. You're like Yes. Unique offer, outreach, then you do, you know, you do positive responses, interactions, booking, and then it scale. And it's like I'm working myself up that ladder of, like, fixing those rings in my agency.\n\nIf you wanna share your screen quickly, I can sort of Yeah.\n\nYeah. I can it's like it's like, let's see.\n\nBecause this is this is important.\n\nEverybody needs to know this. I think I'll probably make a separate YouTube video on it, but we talk about Yeah.\n\nIf you can see my screen, literally Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nThis is It's like agency path.\n\nI literally just have that. Like, that's my background because Yeah.\n\nYou know, you start here, and this is what I need to do to build up and to, just Well, this is really important.\n\nYeah. Obviously, it's a bit neater than when I did it on our coaching call.\n\nBut for for people watching, the the way we sort of try to look at growing an agency is to imagine that you're trying to climb a ladder.\n\nAnd the way to sort of look at building an agency is you start at rung number one, which is coming up with an offer and picking your niche and making all these decisions that have the they sort of set the tone in the initial conditions with the agency. And it people try and think about scaling an agency before they even have a damn niche picked or an offer or an offer defined, or they go and build onboarding systems before they've even got positive replies to onboard clients. It's a Yeah. Very big mistake people make.\n\nIt's like, oh, yeah. I've got this. I just spent the last two weeks building an onboarding funnel. And it's like, okay.\n\nHow many people have you onboarded? None. Why not? Because I haven't got any clients, but I wanted to have an onboarding.\n\nBut it it's really backwards, and there's a lot of pain associated with outreach and sales. And so we have this tendency to go higher up the ladder first and think, oh, yeah. Well, I'll come up with all my SOPs and my onboarding. But the only time you need an onboarding funnel is when you have so many clients that you need to onboard them efficiently.\n\nAnd so this is, yeah, this is really important, and I'm glad that you've, made it a little bit.\n\nIt really stuck with me when you said last time I looked at background.\n\nYeah. That's literally my background. That's my as when I say it, like, that's literally just my desktop background. Like, I look at it.\n\nThis is, like, every time I come to work, this is what I see, and that's just what I need.\n\nSimple concept, though, isn't it? It just makes it so much easier to understand. And, you know, we will look at agents. We think, okay.\n\nWe need to we need to do this. We need to have this. And then, oh, we need to also think about this. But, really, it is just like, which rung of that ladder am I on?\n\nDo I have positive replies? Okay. Yes. Are they booking? Yes. Am I getting sales? No.\n\nOkay. So I need the sales process. Yeah. And think about deliver yeah.\n\nFixing problems as they come and Yeah.\n\nThat's pretty much yeah. It's like, for me, getting essentially, the overall thing of meeting you is, like, I took a step back and realized that I need to, first be consistent. And the only way I can be consistent is if I took a step back and got VAs. If I did the outreach methods that you said and you teach that are, like, very simple and straightforward, and then instead of trying to, like, get it onboard and do all this, focus on the next step is getting responses, getting books, getting bookings, getting sales, and then fix it as it comes. And you, like, need to do.\n\nBut then if I look at this ladder and say, well, what is actually gonna, make my agency, you know, grow? What's the What I actually need to do right now?\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd so The next run.\n\nThat's kinda what I do.\n\nThe other thing I wanted to touch on here, and I I I don't wanna keep you for too long because I know you're probably busy. But your sales conversion rate is very good as well.\n\nDo you wanna talk a little bit about that?\n\nI don't know if you've been through the sales module in the program, if you've been using that at all or not, but be interested to know if you've got any advice.\n\nSo I I actually I watched, most of the sales, but, I noticed that we're kinda, like, on the save. I guess I just got lucky and, like, that I work in the industry, so I kinda know what to say. But it was just I knew that I needed to ask some questions. Yep. I needed to know why they were doing what they were doing, and I needed to make them realize that I could get them where they were going. And that's, like, kinda like the three things.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd, obviously, the way you say it, I was kind of when I was doing it, I was kinda kinda, like, trying to do, oh, I have all these features. I could do this and that. And then when I watched yours, I realized I don't actually need to say any of that. I don't need to like, if if what I'm offering has enough value and I'm actually targeting the right people, by the time we get on the call and we're already you know, I've asked some questions, it's like I've already got them in that state to where Yeah. Like, they want they're ready to go, and they're they're doing it.\n\nSo, yeah, and it's like outreach methods as well.\n\nYeah. Yeah. You you talk about it. It's like, when you do the emotional questions, there might sometimes be people who are like, you know, why am I and it's like you're like, then those aren't your peep those aren't your those aren't your clients.\n\nAnd I was like, because at first, I was like, should I say the emotional stuff? Because they don't want to. And it's like older guys, and they're like, you know, forty, fifties. I'm like, well, I'm asking you, like, oh, is this gonna help your family?\n\nAnd they're like Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut I noticed the ones who actually answer the questions, they're, like, the best clients I have. So I just kinda stick with it and yeah.\n\nYeah. I think a lot of people struggle with the sales part, like, where they know they need to ask these questions that stir up emotions in the prospect, but they they themselves would be afraid to answer them, and so they project that onto the prospect. But when like, if I'm talking to a prospect and I'm like, look, how would this have an impact on your life? If they're like, why would you ask me that?\n\nI'm like, well, because I'm far more driven by the impact I have on your life than how much money I can make from you. And if I understand what sort of influence my product is gonna have on your entire existence and how much responsibility we can take, I'll be far more motivated to help you. And this is what you keep you motivated to continue to help you instead of after you've paid us. So it's really important.\n\nAnd so where do you see the agency going next?\n\nSo, currently, what I'm doing is, because I think I told you it's like there's there's been a lot of changes, more changes in the construction industry than there typically is in the last twenty, thirty years because of current times and stuff like that.\n\nSo I'm trying to, what I've been doing is making sure that I'm still helping and I'm still speaking to my clients in a way. So, literally, I've I've literally sent out, like, a survey to most of my clients asking, like, hey. What do you think is the main thing that made you get on a call? What do you actually feel like you need help with?\n\nLike, when I start speaking to you, what's the thing on your mind that you know you wanna talk to me about? And kinda getting feedback from them on it. So I'm not like and, you know, I don't wanna just be like, hey. I'm doing this one thing, and then none of my industry needs that anymore for it.\n\nSo I'm focusing on that and focusing on, just making sure that I I think we were talking about it getting, you know, not getting scared of, like, oh, I'm getting a lot more not interested. It's just like, yeah. But I'm getting a lot more people looking at my stuff and looking and viewing, and more people are interested. I just need to make sure that I'm not changing my script every other day.\n\nAnd, like, remember we're talking about because I would I would see that, and then I would be like, oh, maybe they don't want that anymore, and I would change it. So instead of doing that and thinking I know what's best, I need to literally just ask my industry and, like, hey. What do you want? What are you currently going through?\n\nAnd so that's what I'm doing. Like, before I change anything, I'm not touching because it's working, obviously, but I'm gonna ask them myself and then go from there on, like, making sure that, you know, I stay consistent, and I I speak to them the way they want to Yeah. I guess.\n\nI think the main lesson here for for everyone watching is you stuck to one niche and one outreach method and one process for six months.\n\nYeah. And it's like what is it? This year, I'm making, like, over a hundred and eighty thousand annually is that's, like, my gross of it, and that, like, that's just me starting in May. So, like, imagine, like, next year.\n\nThat's, like, imagine next year when I'm like from to go from ten k a month with, like, as you said, shitty margins to Yeah.\n\nThirty k a month where you're making twenty, twenty five k in profit. That's insane.\n\nAnd I couldn't be happier for you. I'm really excited to see where you go next as well. I'll probably not hear from you for, like, a year.\n\nYeah.\n\nI paid, like, a hundred and fifty grand last month or something.\n\nYeah. I know.\n\nBut I I think for you next, it's gonna be about hiring a team and maybe building a better outreach system to to keep some consistency in place.\n\nBut, yeah, I really appreciate your time here. And for everybody watching, if you're interested in learning about what we do and how we could help you guys do what Kiwi has done here, there'll be a link below where you can check it out. Kiwi, if you were if you could say to someone who was thinking of joining the program, but they had a reservation like, oh, I'm not sure if it worked. What would you say to them?\n\nI say I mean, your guarantee is pretty good, and you're very honest about it. And I say try it out because within the first month, I'd already made back what what what you were charging.\n\nLike, within that first month you made, like what is that? Some sounds like a twenty x ROI at this point.\n\nYeah. It's like so it's like, if if you're doing such a good guarantee and you're trying to help people, And as soon as they start actually implementing any any because there are multiple outreach methods. A lot of people may start with just the Loom, but you teach cold calling, you teach messaging on social media, you teach there's a lot of different because not everyone wants to, like, cold email. Maybe we focus a lot on looms, but, like, you do Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn. It's like you do everything. So it's like, if there's one outreach method that you know works for your industry and you think you're doing the best, I bet you if you get in this program, Charlie has a better Charlie has a better method of doing it, and that's faster and, like, gets you more consistent results.\n\nSo it's like, literally just hop on a call and you'll, like he literally shows you, like, in the sales. Like, his sales pitch is like I'm getting used to do all the hard work from you guys.\n\nYou guys you guys heard the woman. There'll be a link below, where you can check out what we do in some testimonials. But, yeah, Q and A, it's been amazing. I really appreciate your time here, and, I'm looking forward to seeing when you go next.\n\nSo, Okay. We'll call it a day. Take care. Nice one. You.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/l5rqo0irh1?autoplay=0&wmode=transparent&wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

Hi, everybody. It's Charlie Morgan, and welcome to another video for the channel. Today, I'm joined by one of our awesome clients, Kiwani, who I I think I'm pronouncing that properly. Yeah.\n\nYou did it again.\n\nYeah. And, Kiwani has been working with us for it's been about, what, five or six months, I think, now.\n\nIt's been about six or seven because I signed up in, like, May.\n\nSo May.\n\nOkay. So, yeah, since May time earlier this year, it's now November. And, we didn't really hear much from you since you since you signed up. You know, you you came on board to the program.\n\nAnd I know we could see you were working through the modules and everything, but we didn't really have much, much contact. And then it wasn't until I sort of contacted you earlier this month to say how are things going, and you're like, they're they're doing well. And we I wanted to sort of hop on Zoom with you quickly for everybody just so we can discuss, like, how well you are doing and what you've been implementing. But before we do any of that, do you wanna just take a quick second to introduce yourself and sort of explain who you are and a bit about what what it is?\n\nOkay. So, my name is Keewani, and I, you know, I run a marketing business focused with consulting for remodelers. So it's, like, in the construction niche. And, I've been doing it for about probably, like, a year and a half, maybe two years, depending on what date I actually started. And, I came in a in contact with you guys during, like, May.\n\nI think you sent me, like, probably, like, six follow ups. And I was like, oh, hey. Let me let's see who this person is. And then, like, we got on our phone immediately and, you know, we just hit it off from there.\n\nSo That was awesome.\n\nBut can you hear me okay, by the way? Because I haven't got AirPods, and I'm just going through lots of audio. It doesn't sound like clunky or anything, does it? It sounds like No.\n\nNo. You're I I hear you fine. Mhmm.\n\nCool. Cool. So, yeah, you you joined us back in May. Do you wanna sort of, the obviously, people are watching. They'll understand the sort of, title I'm gonna use for the video is how you've added twenty to thirty k in new monthly revenue to your agency over the course of, like, since we started working together. But before we talk about where you are now, have having applied the program and seen those improvements, do you wanna sort of explain what the situation was before you started working with us and talking talking about that?\n\nOkay. So before I started, working with Charlie, I was about doing about ten thousand in just revenue. That wasn't actually profit.\n\nAnd, you know, in hindsight, I can see my main problem was that, first, I wasn't consistent, and I didn't have, like, a straightforward way of, structuring my agency. Like, I was kinda all over the place. And so that's like, I was doing, you know, ten thousand in revenue, but my profit margins were I was like, why am I using all these different softwares and stuff like that? I was, like, all over the place.\n\nIt was ridiculous. And so yeah. And then I came into the program and, like, actually saw how you, like, structure agency and how you do outreach. And, like, first of all, my profit margins have increased.\n\nI was like, why was I paying for, like, seven different softwares for no reason at all? Yeah.\n\nNo. That's awesome. Because I remember when I first spoke to you, you hadn't been through any previous programs or Yeah. Like, mentorship programs because a lot of people get into the agency space and they buy a course and but you you hadn't had any training before.\n\nYeah. So, pretty much, like, how I did you and because I'd never been really in a course, I, like, I only come in or, like, message when I need something that I can't seem to logically overcome myself. So I got in, and I was just, like, watching all of your videos and seeing how you do it, but I wasn't asking any questions in the group. I was just kinda like, if I had a question, I would go back and rewatch the videos to see if you, you know, answered it there, which is why I didn't have much.\n\nBut then I was like, okay. Maybe I should actually go in the group just to get, like, the atmosphere. Because I know a lot of people say, like, hey. Just being around other people who, do the same thing as you can kinda motivate you to do more.\n\nI'm working on that. I'm still a hermit.\n\nSo, like Well, I think it's I think it's good, and that's why, a lot of our other clients are in a similar situation where we don't get many questions.\n\nAnd, you know, for us, no news is good news. Right? We sort of knew you were probably doing quite well because if you weren't, you'd let us know. But, obviously, you know, as you're aware, the videos are quite long.\n\nAnd some of them are very so we've got, you know, two, three hour videos on on everything.\n\nAnd so, like, quite often, more than more often than not, people don't need to ask questions because we're quite thorough with that, which is something that might be quite useful. So you you started applying, one of our outreach systems, the Loom system that we teach, pretty much straight away.\n\nAnd Yeah. Pretty much straight away.\n\nAnd, like, as soon as I started, that was actually my biggest month when I first implemented the thirty thousand dollar a month I had. That was actually the month I, implemented the Loom, and it's because I was, like, sending out emails myself. I wasn't, consistent, and I was sending out a lower volume.\n\nAnd so then when I implemented your Loom system of being able to kinda step away and put VAs at the same place, it's like it blew up of because how were you getting clients before?\n\nSo before is, like I was saying is I actually like, my dad, I have brothers and things that are in the construction industry. So I was literally just I I was telling them, hey, like, you know, I I I work with workers and, you know, in construction, they would, like, send me somebody. And so it wasn't as consistent. Like, I was still sending emails, but I wasn't really getting responses. All my my sales was from, like, you know, getting my dad or somebody to get me somebody.\n\nLike, it was word-of-mouth, to profit margins Yeah.\n\nAs you mentioned.\n\nAnd so you went from ten k with no structure and just chaos to, what, a thirty or forty a month in that month?\n\nYeah. So, yeah, it was like a thirty, k a month for the first month, and then, like, I consistently saw do around twenty to, you know, twenty five thousand. And I'm just kind of trying to nail in, you know, who my, you know, ideal client is, and I'm trying to work through that.\n\nMhmm.\n\nSo there and then there are some, like, real stuff in the course that, like, when I heard it, it really changed my whole perspective of a lot of things too.\n\nWhen I like, you said something in the course about, well, you did a metaphor.\n\nYou did a lot of metaphors, but you're like I did.\n\nI'm very I'm very guilty. Like, we get this a lot where, like, one of the easiest ways for us to explain complex, like, things is just to put it into a metaphor, but you go yeah. Go ahead.\n\nBut you said it was the reason why we have our agency, our business, is to help businesses. And you explained in a metaphor when you're meditating, you know, you hear birds, but you start focusing more on that than just meditating and getting the benefit of it. And it's sad to say I realized that when I started this agency was because, like, you can make money with this. Yeah.\n\nAnd I wasn't focusing or dialing into what's actually gonna help businesses. Like, what can I actually do to help them? Mhmm. And, like, realizing that is kinda changing what am I talking about.\n\nLike, when I send emails, when I'm singing looms, it's like, how am I actually helping them, and how do I convey that message? And you really go into that in the course of, like, you know, like, because strategies are good, but if I don't have the right, like, you know, morals or mindset of why I'm doing this, it kinda seems like, you know, pointless.\n\nYeah. And and just to touch on what you said there just so everybody sort of understands. So one of the the main sort of things that we teach in the program because, obviously, as you're probably aware of the program, we have, like a lot of stuff is strategic, but we also have a lot of sort of perspective based mindset stuff. And it's usually just by looking at it in a different way that everything falls into place.\n\nBut what you were talking about there for everybody's sake is, I've got this meditation headband called Muse, and you can sort of meditate with it and you have your headphones in. And when you meditate nice and clearly and focus on your breath, the the headband and the headphones start playing in these little birds. You can hear these birds. And what I started to do mistakenly was I'd meditate so I could hear those birds because I knew it was a good form of feedback.\n\nBut as soon as you focus on the birds, you're losing the breath, which means you're losing the byproduct you actually want to achieve. And so you focus on the thing that produces the thing you want, which in this case is just adding value to businesses.\n\nSo I'm I'm glad that proved valuable. And so we've we've got probably, like, four or five other organic strategies in the program. Have you tried experiments with those at all?\n\nOr that is actually what, I'm looking at now to try to get it more consistent and, you know, scale it is because, you know, construction is kinda like a traditional industry.\n\nIt doesn't really change as much as it what has it has in the last year. So, like, it seems like cold calling because they pick up their phone. Like, I do voice mail drops like you, you recommend it, and those do work really well. So I'm like, maybe I do need to just call, pick up but, like, you know, cold calling, like, is different from sending emails, so I kinda gotta get over this.\n\nIn you can check out because we've got a section on a phone.\n\nI saw that. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nI'm, like, starting to go through that and, like, I need to just, you know, face it and, like because I'm making it bigger than what it is. I know that. So I'm, like, just get on the phone and, like, actually start talking to them about it. So yeah. So I can have, like, two points.\n\nIt's really easy to be scared. And then you start making phone calls because the script we have for cold calling makes makes it so easy. I don't know how far you've got through the the cold calling module yet, but the sort of opening line we use tends to diffuse any sort of fear or tension you might have, which usually makes it ten times easier. And so when you when you look over the over the since we started in May and the last six to seven months, for example, what would you say is, like, one of the one or two of the most important things that you've learned from the program aside from the focusing thing that matters? Like, what would you say we've taught you that's really helped you get to that ten to thirty k a month?\n\nSo it'd more be, obviously, consistency, but also I feel like once I started making money, I didn't I didn't look at how to, scale or take a step back myself. Like, I was still sending all the things and emails myself, and it was like, I'm only one person. I can only do so much in the day. And no matter what I say, like, I know how to send emails and stuff like that, but I'm not the best. Like, there are VAEs out there that can send, like, a hundred in, like, you know, in a short time span. It's like, I know there's people better than me, so why am I, like, focusing on trying to do everything myself?\n\nMhmm.\n\nAnd, like, once I, like, took a step back and was able to look at my business, it's like, I'm doing, what is it, like, twenty around, like, eighteen to twenty thousand in profit now. Like, that's not just revenue. And it's like, I was doing I was doing just ten thousand in revenue. Like so it's like that's like a totally different, ballgame.\n\nAnd so I'm, like, trying to Manage it.\n\nEssentially, like you say in your in your we talked about it even last time. You said there's multiple steps in the agency. Like, if I can literally show you my screen, I literally have the steps you put. You're like Yes. Unique offer, outreach, then you do, you know, you do positive responses, interactions, booking, and then it scale. And it's like I'm working myself up that ladder of, like, fixing those rings in my agency.\n\nIf you wanna share your screen quickly, I can sort of Yeah.\n\nYeah. I can it's like it's like, let's see.\n\nBecause this is this is important.\n\nEverybody needs to know this. I think I'll probably make a separate YouTube video on it, but we talk about Yeah.\n\nIf you can see my screen, literally Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nThis is It's like agency path.\n\nI literally just have that. Like, that's my background because Yeah.\n\nYou know, you start here, and this is what I need to do to build up and to, just Well, this is really important.\n\nYeah. Obviously, it's a bit neater than when I did it on our coaching call.\n\nBut for for people watching, the the way we sort of try to look at growing an agency is to imagine that you're trying to climb a ladder.\n\nAnd the way to sort of look at building an agency is you start at rung number one, which is coming up with an offer and picking your niche and making all these decisions that have the they sort of set the tone in the initial conditions with the agency. And it people try and think about scaling an agency before they even have a damn niche picked or an offer or an offer defined, or they go and build onboarding systems before they've even got positive replies to onboard clients. It's a Yeah. Very big mistake people make.\n\nIt's like, oh, yeah. I've got this. I just spent the last two weeks building an onboarding funnel. And it's like, okay.\n\nHow many people have you onboarded? None. Why not? Because I haven't got any clients, but I wanted to have an onboarding.\n\nBut it it's really backwards, and there's a lot of pain associated with outreach and sales. And so we have this tendency to go higher up the ladder first and think, oh, yeah. Well, I'll come up with all my SOPs and my onboarding. But the only time you need an onboarding funnel is when you have so many clients that you need to onboard them efficiently.\n\nAnd so this is, yeah, this is really important, and I'm glad that you've, made it a little bit.\n\nIt really stuck with me when you said last time I looked at background.\n\nYeah. That's literally my background. That's my as when I say it, like, that's literally just my desktop background. Like, I look at it.\n\nThis is, like, every time I come to work, this is what I see, and that's just what I need.\n\nSimple concept, though, isn't it? It just makes it so much easier to understand. And, you know, we will look at agents. We think, okay.\n\nWe need to we need to do this. We need to have this. And then, oh, we need to also think about this. But, really, it is just like, which rung of that ladder am I on?\n\nDo I have positive replies? Okay. Yes. Are they booking? Yes. Am I getting sales? No.\n\nOkay. So I need the sales process. Yeah. And think about deliver yeah.\n\nFixing problems as they come and Yeah.\n\nThat's pretty much yeah. It's like, for me, getting essentially, the overall thing of meeting you is, like, I took a step back and realized that I need to, first be consistent. And the only way I can be consistent is if I took a step back and got VAs. If I did the outreach methods that you said and you teach that are, like, very simple and straightforward, and then instead of trying to, like, get it onboard and do all this, focus on the next step is getting responses, getting books, getting bookings, getting sales, and then fix it as it comes. And you, like, need to do.\n\nBut then if I look at this ladder and say, well, what is actually gonna, make my agency, you know, grow? What's the What I actually need to do right now?\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd so The next run.\n\nThat's kinda what I do.\n\nThe other thing I wanted to touch on here, and I I I don't wanna keep you for too long because I know you're probably busy. But your sales conversion rate is very good as well.\n\nDo you wanna talk a little bit about that?\n\nI don't know if you've been through the sales module in the program, if you've been using that at all or not, but be interested to know if you've got any advice.\n\nSo I I actually I watched, most of the sales, but, I noticed that we're kinda, like, on the save. I guess I just got lucky and, like, that I work in the industry, so I kinda know what to say. But it was just I knew that I needed to ask some questions. Yep. I needed to know why they were doing what they were doing, and I needed to make them realize that I could get them where they were going. And that's, like, kinda like the three things.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd, obviously, the way you say it, I was kind of when I was doing it, I was kinda kinda, like, trying to do, oh, I have all these features. I could do this and that. And then when I watched yours, I realized I don't actually need to say any of that. I don't need to like, if if what I'm offering has enough value and I'm actually targeting the right people, by the time we get on the call and we're already you know, I've asked some questions, it's like I've already got them in that state to where Yeah. Like, they want they're ready to go, and they're they're doing it.\n\nSo, yeah, and it's like outreach methods as well.\n\nYeah. Yeah. You you talk about it. It's like, when you do the emotional questions, there might sometimes be people who are like, you know, why am I and it's like you're like, then those aren't your peep those aren't your those aren't your clients.\n\nAnd I was like, because at first, I was like, should I say the emotional stuff? Because they don't want to. And it's like older guys, and they're like, you know, forty, fifties. I'm like, well, I'm asking you, like, oh, is this gonna help your family?\n\nAnd they're like Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut I noticed the ones who actually answer the questions, they're, like, the best clients I have. So I just kinda stick with it and yeah.\n\nYeah. I think a lot of people struggle with the sales part, like, where they know they need to ask these questions that stir up emotions in the prospect, but they they themselves would be afraid to answer them, and so they project that onto the prospect. But when like, if I'm talking to a prospect and I'm like, look, how would this have an impact on your life? If they're like, why would you ask me that?\n\nI'm like, well, because I'm far more driven by the impact I have on your life than how much money I can make from you. And if I understand what sort of influence my product is gonna have on your entire existence and how much responsibility we can take, I'll be far more motivated to help you. And this is what you keep you motivated to continue to help you instead of after you've paid us. So it's really important.\n\nAnd so where do you see the agency going next?\n\nSo, currently, what I'm doing is, because I think I told you it's like there's there's been a lot of changes, more changes in the construction industry than there typically is in the last twenty, thirty years because of current times and stuff like that.\n\nSo I'm trying to, what I've been doing is making sure that I'm still helping and I'm still speaking to my clients in a way. So, literally, I've I've literally sent out, like, a survey to most of my clients asking, like, hey. What do you think is the main thing that made you get on a call? What do you actually feel like you need help with?\n\nLike, when I start speaking to you, what's the thing on your mind that you know you wanna talk to me about? And kinda getting feedback from them on it. So I'm not like and, you know, I don't wanna just be like, hey. I'm doing this one thing, and then none of my industry needs that anymore for it.\n\nSo I'm focusing on that and focusing on, just making sure that I I think we were talking about it getting, you know, not getting scared of, like, oh, I'm getting a lot more not interested. It's just like, yeah. But I'm getting a lot more people looking at my stuff and looking and viewing, and more people are interested. I just need to make sure that I'm not changing my script every other day.\n\nAnd, like, remember we're talking about because I would I would see that, and then I would be like, oh, maybe they don't want that anymore, and I would change it. So instead of doing that and thinking I know what's best, I need to literally just ask my industry and, like, hey. What do you want? What are you currently going through?\n\nAnd so that's what I'm doing. Like, before I change anything, I'm not touching because it's working, obviously, but I'm gonna ask them myself and then go from there on, like, making sure that, you know, I stay consistent, and I I speak to them the way they want to Yeah. I guess.\n\nI think the main lesson here for for everyone watching is you stuck to one niche and one outreach method and one process for six months.\n\nYeah. And it's like what is it? This year, I'm making, like, over a hundred and eighty thousand annually is that's, like, my gross of it, and that, like, that's just me starting in May. So, like, imagine, like, next year.\n\nThat's, like, imagine next year when I'm like from to go from ten k a month with, like, as you said, shitty margins to Yeah.\n\nThirty k a month where you're making twenty, twenty five k in profit. That's insane.\n\nAnd I couldn't be happier for you. I'm really excited to see where you go next as well. I'll probably not hear from you for, like, a year.\n\nYeah.\n\nI paid, like, a hundred and fifty grand last month or something.\n\nYeah. I know.\n\nBut I I think for you next, it's gonna be about hiring a team and maybe building a better outreach system to to keep some consistency in place.\n\nBut, yeah, I really appreciate your time here. And for everybody watching, if you're interested in learning about what we do and how we could help you guys do what Kiwi has done here, there'll be a link below where you can check it out. Kiwi, if you were if you could say to someone who was thinking of joining the program, but they had a reservation like, oh, I'm not sure if it worked. What would you say to them?\n\nI say I mean, your guarantee is pretty good, and you're very honest about it. And I say try it out because within the first month, I'd already made back what what what you were charging.\n\nLike, within that first month you made, like what is that? Some sounds like a twenty x ROI at this point.\n\nYeah. It's like so it's like, if if you're doing such a good guarantee and you're trying to help people, And as soon as they start actually implementing any any because there are multiple outreach methods. A lot of people may start with just the Loom, but you teach cold calling, you teach messaging on social media, you teach there's a lot of different because not everyone wants to, like, cold email. Maybe we focus a lot on looms, but, like, you do Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn. It's like you do everything. So it's like, if there's one outreach method that you know works for your industry and you think you're doing the best, I bet you if you get in this program, Charlie has a better Charlie has a better method of doing it, and that's faster and, like, gets you more consistent results.\n\nSo it's like, literally just hop on a call and you'll, like he literally shows you, like, in the sales. Like, his sales pitch is like I'm getting used to do all the hard work from you guys.\n\nYou guys you guys heard the woman. There'll be a link below, where you can check out what we do in some testimonials. But, yeah, Q and A, it's been amazing. I really appreciate your time here, and, I'm looking forward to seeing when you go next.\n\nSo, Okay. We'll call it a day. Take care. Nice one. You."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}}, {});
