It's Charlie Morgan, and welcome to another video. So in today's video, it's a slightly different format. I'm gonna be walking you through some results we've got for one of our clients, a guy called Luca, who started with us at basically zero clients, zero meetings, very, very frustrating situation for him.\n\nHe was sending thousands and thousands of outreach emails, was landing no meetings, no clients, no money, no nothing, lots of stress, lots of pain, a situation that most agency owners are very familiar with, including myself, you know, four or five years ago. And Luke has been with us since April, but he started the program bring him to about forty k a month in his agency. So, technically, he's gone from zero to forty k a month, over the course of the last three to five months, which is fucking insane. And he's done it using our program, and I could not be happier for him and more proud of his results.\n\nAnd I wanted to share them with you, and, hopefully, you can deduce some, well, you can get some knowledge and some ideas from his experiences working with us, and I recorded a quick student interview with him to sort of just, a, demonstrate that he's a real human and that I'm not making this up because it almost is too good to be true. Like, zero to ten k a week in basically, like, four months is mad.\n\nBut it is true, and it's awesome. And that's how much I love the program we have because it's fucking amazing. So I'm gonna clip that in now, and in the link well, there'll be a link to a funnel. I know you hate funnels.\n\nI hate funnels. I'm not gonna give you free training or a case study. Don't worry. But there'll be a link to, a page where you can check out what we do, some results, and just have a good look at everything that we're all about.\n\nAnd if you want to book a call from there, you can.\n\nIf you don't want to, that's fine by me. But I'll talk to you soon, and I'll click it in now. Talk soon. So hey, everyone. It's Charlie Morgan, and welcome to another video. A bit of a different style today.\n\nToday, I'm going to be running through a quick interview with one of my favorite students. Not that I have favorites, but Luca here has done very well with us over the last five months since he joined in the spring. As of us recording this, it's currently November twenty twenty one. And, Lucas start when did you start with us? Like, in in March or something? It was, like, six months ago.\n\nI don't think it was that longer. I think it was May or April, they're in around.\n\nSometime before the summer for here in the UK.\n\nBut the reason we're on today's call, for you guys listening or watching is just to sort of give you an idea as to how Luke has done what he's done. And what he's done is basically go from, basically, a brand new agency with no clients in a pretty, if you don't mind me saying, like, desperate situation, trying to find clients and following Yeah. Poor advice.\n\nAnd now Luca makes ten thousand dollars per week.\n\nAnd for full transparency, that's, like, not a mega consistent thing yet. It's an it's not an anomaly. We're on the right direction. But last week, it was, like, ten grand if I'm not mistaken. Right?\n\nIt was indeed.\n\nYeah. And so the purpose of this is for you guys to understand how we could do that. But, also, the subpurpose is obviously for me to invite you to talk to us about how we could help you achieve similar results, but we're gonna leave with value. So, yeah. So, Luca, why don't you just start by introducing yourself, just talking a bit about, like, who you are, what your agency is all about, and then we'll just dive into some specifics about how you've done what you've done.\n\nPerfect. So my name is Luca.\n\nI am from south, I'm from Southeast London, and I have had my agency. We we supply leads for realtors.\n\nWe've been going since I've started the program. I think it was April. But, actually, I it took me about two months to really get going because I had a lot of stuff happening. So Yeah. Since about August, is when we've really been running.\n\nSo August over June July, August, really been starting really been running. We provide leads for realtors only in the US and Canada. Mhmm.\n\nAnd within the last few months, it's just scaled to, a level in which I actually didn't think I'd hit until probably probably that was in my three year plan.\n\nSo yeah, it was What was the the three year plan?\n\nSo the three year plan, was to be able to consistently sign, ten thousand pounds worth sort of ten thousand dollars worth of clients every week. Wow.\n\nWe're now on a Monday again, and I've signed another.\n\nSo So we we basically, in essence, helped you do what you wanted to do in three years and three months.\n\nYeah. That's awesome, man. So you you picked everything up properly really in July. So you had July, August, September and obviously October.\n\nSo that's a four month process, which is fantastic. And so you weren't always in the realtor space, were you? Where were you before coaching me? No.\n\nSo I was one of the many, one of the mass, that saw a ecommerce boom ecommerce agency boom. So I had an ecommerce store, went on to do quite well with from it. And how we worked out was when it all came to when it went south, which they all do, dropshipping stores and things like that. So what happened is I thought, I can do the ads. I've done the ads myself. Why don't I start up a marketing agency? Yep.\n\nI thought signing a client would be easiest thing you'll ever do.\n\nTurns out it wasn't, and I spent sort of from November to probably April Yep.\n\nJust reaching out to thousands of brands.\n\nI had no real structure.\n\nI had no real offer.\n\nI had nothing, and it makes sense why it didn't work.\n\nBut, yeah, now we're I then went on to sign off the calls, jump in, be a part of it. And, then I basically said, look. I need to really get my head right. I really need to make sure that I know what what the best plan for me is.\n\nAnd how I done that was I said, what's what niche should I do?\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd within about four minutes, if that seconds, it was it was decided.\n\nYep.\n\nAnd at the start, I thought, bollocks. This isn't good.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut, actually, and and, actually, up until about five weeks ago, I thought the same thing. So Yeah. I can't really and even now, I'm not sure. You know, like, you can never I don't think I don't think I'll ever be too sure. But, yeah, I'm I'm now really enjoying it. I'm loving it.\n\nYeah. Because I was I was gonna mention because, obviously, like, when you joined us, the the thing you was lacking was the strategy and the the the actual proper process or the updated version of of outreach and everything like that. But what what I think we found with you specifically and the problem that we had to overcome was that sort of mental one of that sort of always looking for something that's a little bit better or always looking for the greener grass when in reality it's sort of just sticking to that one thing. Now, you mentioned earlier, like obviously you were doing thousands and thousands of reach reaching out to brands and stuff in the e com space.\n\nAnd that's true for a lot of agencies. And it's a painful, painful problem that I'm sure people watching this video right now resonate with When you came on board with us, what what do you think were the main things that you learned that allowed you to sort of think, okay, I've actually now got a new because it was quite a lot. It's it's a big transformation, but if you could sort of summarize it in a couple of things, not to put you on the spot.\n\nThe main thing, it was actually having people around me who weren't just who haven't just sort of taken money and gone.\n\nRight.\n\nFrom from again, here was some like you, Beau, and, actually, everyone in there.\n\nEveryone chats. We talk pretty much daily.\n\nYeah. If if someone puts a a question in the group, normally, someone will beat you to the reply. You You know? There's always someone to help.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd that was a great start.\n\nThem call we have calls on a Tuesday and a Friday. They're another because that was huge. Yep. And Loom Alchemy.\n\nYeah.\n\nWe have to say Loom Alchemy.\n\nYeah. To give to give everyone context is did you tell me why don't you explain in in your own words what Lume alchemy is?\n\nIt's a module we have in the program, but if you were to put it yeah, it it's a module in the program which has, basically taken me from zero to everything now because I have followed it. We have all followed it, and I genuinely don't think there's one person who doesn't get sort of one to four Meetings a day.\n\nReplies slash meetings. I I'm probably three meetings a day from it.\n\nI know a lot of others. Some people are doing far more. Some people are doing less. But everyone's working on consistent meetings. And, it's it's, the most personalized, unpersonalized outreach in the world.\n\nYeah. Like the most automated, but also personalized.\n\nYou know, I think it's an interesting one because when we were building that, our philosophy was like, people, when it comes to outreach is they have this sort of belief where it has to be quality or it has to be quantity. Like, you can't have both is what people thought. And we looked at that, and we were like, fuck that. Like, you know, we should just combine the two. And I think that's probably why it works quite well.\n\nAnd obviously that that's proven that it does. Yeah.\n\nThree meetings a day and, you know, for like some agency owners, they they'd be happy with the meeting a day.\n\nAnd so now that, now that you're in the position where ten ks weeks and two to three client weeks feel normal to you, where do you see yourself going next? Not only with what we have in the program, but also because it's obviously that it's a very new feeling novelty for you to have this level of growth.\n\nBut what do you think is next for you?\n\nScaling.\n\nI've proven to myself that I can do it. That's one of the huge parts. It's a great question as well because I actually thought about it Friday Friday afternoon when I was finishing work.\n\nYep.\n\nWhen I was wrapping everything up, I thought, what now? This was the goal.\n\nThis was the goal.\n\nIt's like we did it's like my three year goal has been realized.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd then I thought, actually, now I need to do this every week and double it and double it again and double it again, and then just build my team out, build out just and and, actually, I think service delivery, I wanna get everything down to such a great, such nothing's ever perfect. I get it. But so near to perfection that, I I could happily sort of be able to go away for a day or not work. I have such a great team behind me that they will close every all the sales. They but that I think that's now the the next step. Mhmm.\n\nBecause, obviously, that's we we have the service delivery module in the program, which we released today, which I think will be there for you. And, like, the the reason we've done that is because we what we found with a lot of clients like your situation now is we once we solve the appointment booking and sales problem and the dilemma that comes with not having clients, you're then like, okay. What's next? And I feel like most people who who coach, not to name any names, but as you you've experienced before, and I'm sure everybody else watching this has experienced before, you've bought nine nine seven programs or slightly higher ticket programs from people on Instagram or YouTube, and their courses just aren't up to scratch. What what do you feel is different between what you the value you've received from us and the processes we've given you and the courses that you've seen beforehand? What would you say are the differences, or how would you describe that?\n\nQuite one, because it's actually solely down to one thing, and it's we build our own agencies. You know, there's a hundred at the time of today, I think there's a hundred and seventeen people in the course.\n\nYep.\n\nI would say a hundred and seventeen people have their own agency.\n\nNo one copies each other. Isn't that there was never a script?\n\nThere was never one set email line and then this and then this, and you build it all out yourself, but you use proven methods that that I would say are the best as well to be had to say. But, and I I've done various courses, and I've never I've never got any traction. I've never been able to really get there.\n\nBut, actually, marketing where Yeah.\n\nI'm we're we're doing our own testing, split testing emails with this and this. And there there there's so many different tests, and we're doing Facebook, and we're doing LinkedIn, and we're doing but this is all off of our own back, but it's also what we've been taught. Yeah. So it's like, We've actually built our own agencies.\n\nThis is the difference. There is no copy and pasting. There is no yeah. I think the only copy and pasting is their website.\n\nBut I didn't even use it.\n\nNo.\n\nYou can get away with with the website. And I think this is a common a common dilemma with agency coaching programs or usually lack thereof in the coaching. There's not much of that at all.\n\nBut, like, you know, what happens is someone puts together something in Teachable over the course of a month, and they sell it, and then they just don't update it. But we've and I think this is as you've just described, the process we try to follow is to teach you the principles. I would rather, like you know the whole phrase, like, give a man a fish, feed him for a day, teach a man to fish, feed him for a lifetime?\n\nYeah.\n\nI think what we try to do at the program is give you the tools, like because what what's gonna work on a module for next year, and I'm not sure if you're aware of this or not, on, like, how we actually the the the critical thought process that we go through to build the systems.\n\nAnd, like, because, obviously, at the moment, you've got the program and you can pull apart different lessons and come up with your own methods which you've done and which are working for you. And that the reason you're doing so well is because you've taken it upon yourself to do that, and we set the expectation that that's what needs to be done. But in the future we quite like to have like this is our process for coming up with copy. This is our process for testing. This is exact. And I think that that's the main thing because otherwise, you've just got two hundred, three hundred thousand people all singing the same song, and it sucks.\n\nAnd that is what most of it is. Yeah. And I hate to say it, but the amount of emails I get, which are, this is new or Yeah. It's bright. Like, I had one the other day. It was a it was a it's a breath of fresh air to see you're not all the same, and I thought that was hilarious.\n\nThen we've even started doing what the the Facebook outreach, and it's just completely different. It's my I've switched my phone off, but it was like I sent it over to you. It wasn't it was crazy. It was like, wow.\n\nThis is the best I've ever seen. And because of that, I'll book a call with you. Yeah. I've actually got a call after this call.\n\nSo Yeah.\n\nIt is it is, yeah, it is such a great feeling. You know? And, and I I personally I know people say, like, yeah, you get used to it. I don't I don't think I will just for the simple fact of I can't I enjoy getting on the calls.\n\nSo, I know a lot of people dread it. You're the same sort of mind as I am, but I actually enjoy getting on the calls. And this is, I think, one of the benefits of of being able to do this and and being able to book so many calls is that my day is just so much better. It's so much better than it ever was.\n\nThat's awesome, man. And so just going back to what you were saying before, about building your own systems and stuff, what do you feel is a couple of one of one or two of the main parts of the program that have taught you to think of yourself?\n\nAre there any sort of obviously, I'm putting you on the spot here and Yeah.\n\nWhen you're writing with your own scripts, with your own script, we have there's different ways of sour scripts, and you basically build your own. Mhmm.\n\nYou have building your own team, building that system out, building your own sales scripts.\n\nAnd it comes down to the little things like on the Louvre alchemy, the the wording, the, I would just say on a whole, you could without even without having to bring in a new module, I think that you could quite simply systemize and scale the business by any business because I know that there are a few people who are coaches, for instance, in it, and and I'm sure they're still using it.\n\nAnd I I think it's become if you really just work if you just do it, it will work. And I think everyone in there has seen that.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat actually, when you really do it and and I've went and got VAs, and I went and got this, and I went and got even down to that, I had VAs working before. And it was never they were always it was come and go, come and go. Yeah. Now I have one I'm more than one VA, but I have people doing specific outreach and get getting leads. And they've been with me since August, and they're not going anywhere.\n\nNo revolving door, but Yeah. Since this Yeah.\n\nAnd it's really building out the team. Like, my everything.\n\nEverything for it. Everything about it is just it allows you to simply scale, and and boost, I think, everyone in there is going.\n\nYeah. When you when you look at Imperium Agency and the the business we have, where do you in in relation to the other people in the market and the competition, eighteen, twenty four months from now, where do you think we would be based on the product and your experience with us so far?\n\nI think you'll have about fifteen hundred to two thousand students to say the least.\n\nYeah. A hundred percent. Well, if everyone all it comes down to is also whether people are willing to really go and give money and to benefit themselves. Mhmm. I get it. Not everyone can, but I would say I would put well, now if I was to if I if I was to have had the money, now is all the money I had, and I couldn't do anything else six months ago, and you just told me now, then I would have obviously put every penny I had down.\n\nAnd I'm back and buying Bitcoin if you could.\n\nYeah. I would have got everything. I would have just been at I would have just done everything I could to get it. But, yeah, it's it's because now it's, now I've got it. Yeah.\n\nActually, it's benefit me far more than anything else ever.\n\nI think you should give yourself a lot of the credit because of how hard you've worked and how much you've applied yourself and controlled your mind and just actually done the damn thing, which is which is good. Good thing.\n\nWell, yeah, I've also found it quite fun, the whole experience. That was that was a huge thing as well. It wasn't there's no it wasn't tedious, and there are I'm not gonna even deny it. There are some parts of the course, but videos that I haven't watched because it wasn't the right one for me, and it was something that I knew. But Yeah. Everything I've watched has been a everything I've watched has been very valuable for me, to me. And and, yeah, it's worked.\n\nAnd Papifima. And so once again, just to describe your situation before you came on board with us. So you're in a niche that wasn't really taking you anywhere. You were sending, you know, hundreds, if not well, you were literally sending thousands of outreach messages to get no appointments, but I can imagine that as demotivating.\n\nYou You probably felt like you wanted to give up on the agency. You felt like you'd lost faith in mentors, and you just thought that it was just difficult and hard.\n\nTo people in that situation, what advice would you give them knowing what you know now? And you're not only by the course.\n\nNo.\n\nDon't trust everything you see, because there's a lot of people who will tell you they're doing one and they're not.\n\nAnd, realistically, it's actually just do the fucking work. I never would.\n\nI never would, and I would always try and outsource it.\n\nAnd in this case, I didn't have a choice. I had to do it. Yeah. I used to get a VA and say, like, come up with drone script.\n\nLike, of course, it didn't work.\n\nYeah.\n\nNo no one's saying that's never gonna work.\n\nYeah.\n\nWhereas now, I'm I'm updating it almost daily, spit testing it.\n\nGot a lady in the calls called Alba, and she came up with some phenomenal content, which I have to actually say is is that email alone.\n\nWhat's all got me in my last four clients?\n\nYeah. Yeah. This is the thing. It's like that's why the commute is so awesome because people come up with shit, and they're like, oh, guys. This might work.\n\nAnd we've got it in such a nice sort of, like because when both And Jamie.\n\nAnd Jamie as well. Yeah. I mean, when we when we started it, we we didn't really anticipate the culture being as active and, like, altruistic as we did. We just, you know, because you you'd expect if you've because I know you talked to some guys we've got who are also in the realtor space, and you share ideas and strategy. Yeah. And it's nice that that culture has has come about because of the you know, a lot of people try and keep their cards close to their chest, but being able to give and take with people who are solving the same problems as you is is infinitely valuable. And, Yeah.\n\nWe're we're in London. So the one of the other ones who's in, the realtor space, I went for dinner with him a little while ago. I I might as well be in an office with him because we're actually just on FaceTime to each other all day long.\n\nSo it it it that you know, like, yeah, there is genuine people in here, and it's not just people in all over the world who never speak to every everything's mine mine mine.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt's like we're in the same niche. We're we're trying to get the same clients, but we both help each other out. Like, I set something up for him the other day. He's he's abroad, so I set up some new emails.\n\nJust vice versa. You know? Like, we we shouldn't be helping each other. Yeah. But we're all we will understand that if you're trying to argue over ten clients in a niche where you've got a hundred and fifty thousand of them Yeah. You're doing something seriously wrong.\n\nYeah. It's the same thing when we take on because, obviously, our agency works at gyms, and quite a few of Imperium people work with gyms. People are like, what the hell are you doing? Like, you're helping your competition. It's like, dude, there's, like, seventy thousand gyms.\n\nIf we find if we find a guy who wants to work with twenty gyms, there's a spit in the ocean. It's like, it doesn't make a difference, and, and being able to to offer that help is is useful, man. Luca, mate, it's been an absolute pleasure. I think we both have to go for sales calls now conveniently.\n\nYeah. But in in closing, if if you were if you were watching this, as someone who used to be in your situation, who was thinking, oh, that program sounds kinda cool. What would you say to them about the program in, you know, at that point? Just curious.\n\nDo it.\n\nYou you you will be head busting the wall until you buy this because you you will do the same thing wrong again and again and again, and there is nothing that will teach you to do something right. And, actually, this has taught me what to do right, how to do it, but it's also allowed me to teach myself.\n\nSo if it was my old self, I'd just say just buy the fucking cool stuff here. Stop being an idiot. You can you've you've seen into the future. You know what's gonna happen.\n\nSo Yeah, man.\n\nAwesome. Well, listen. I think we'll we'll wrap it up there. Greatly appreciate your time, and I'm looking forward to doing this, when you do you know, we'll do another one when you get to thirty k a week or something.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut when we hit six figures a month Yeah.\n\nWhen you hit that hundred k a month mark, which will probably happen a lot faster than you expect, because the the the most difficult thing is getting to ten k a month.\n\nOnce you get to ten k the fact you've got ten k a week as as quickly as you have, that's like I went from a month to a week.\n\nYeah. You're nice. Think support just you just skipped the month. You're like you're like, fuck that. It's too small. Just gonna skip it.\n\nDude, listen.\n\nI'll leave you to it, and, we can call it a day.\n\nSee you later.\n\nThanks for coming, brother.\n\nThank you, mate. Ciao. Bye bye.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/dcae86bl4h?autoplay=0&wmode=transparent&wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

It's Charlie Morgan, and welcome to another video. So in today's video, it's a slightly different format. I'm gonna be walking you through some results we've got for one of our clients, a guy called Luca, who started with us at basically zero clients, zero meetings, very, very frustrating situation for him.\n\nHe was sending thousands and thousands of outreach emails, was landing no meetings, no clients, no money, no nothing, lots of stress, lots of pain, a situation that most agency owners are very familiar with, including myself, you know, four or five years ago. And Luke has been with us since April, but he started the program bring him to about forty k a month in his agency. So, technically, he's gone from zero to forty k a month, over the course of the last three to five months, which is fucking insane. And he's done it using our program, and I could not be happier for him and more proud of his results.\n\nAnd I wanted to share them with you, and, hopefully, you can deduce some, well, you can get some knowledge and some ideas from his experiences working with us, and I recorded a quick student interview with him to sort of just, a, demonstrate that he's a real human and that I'm not making this up because it almost is too good to be true. Like, zero to ten k a week in basically, like, four months is mad.\n\nBut it is true, and it's awesome. And that's how much I love the program we have because it's fucking amazing. So I'm gonna clip that in now, and in the link well, there'll be a link to a funnel. I know you hate funnels.\n\nI hate funnels. I'm not gonna give you free training or a case study. Don't worry. But there'll be a link to, a page where you can check out what we do, some results, and just have a good look at everything that we're all about.\n\nAnd if you want to book a call from there, you can.\n\nIf you don't want to, that's fine by me. But I'll talk to you soon, and I'll click it in now. Talk soon. So hey, everyone. It's Charlie Morgan, and welcome to another video. A bit of a different style today.\n\nToday, I'm going to be running through a quick interview with one of my favorite students. Not that I have favorites, but Luca here has done very well with us over the last five months since he joined in the spring. As of us recording this, it's currently November twenty twenty one. And, Lucas start when did you start with us? Like, in in March or something? It was, like, six months ago.\n\nI don't think it was that longer. I think it was May or April, they're in around.\n\nSometime before the summer for here in the UK.\n\nBut the reason we're on today's call, for you guys listening or watching is just to sort of give you an idea as to how Luke has done what he's done. And what he's done is basically go from, basically, a brand new agency with no clients in a pretty, if you don't mind me saying, like, desperate situation, trying to find clients and following Yeah. Poor advice.\n\nAnd now Luca makes ten thousand dollars per week.\n\nAnd for full transparency, that's, like, not a mega consistent thing yet. It's an it's not an anomaly. We're on the right direction. But last week, it was, like, ten grand if I'm not mistaken. Right?\n\nIt was indeed.\n\nYeah. And so the purpose of this is for you guys to understand how we could do that. But, also, the subpurpose is obviously for me to invite you to talk to us about how we could help you achieve similar results, but we're gonna leave with value. So, yeah. So, Luca, why don't you just start by introducing yourself, just talking a bit about, like, who you are, what your agency is all about, and then we'll just dive into some specifics about how you've done what you've done.\n\nPerfect. So my name is Luca.\n\nI am from south, I'm from Southeast London, and I have had my agency. We we supply leads for realtors.\n\nWe've been going since I've started the program. I think it was April. But, actually, I it took me about two months to really get going because I had a lot of stuff happening. So Yeah. Since about August, is when we've really been running.\n\nSo August over June July, August, really been starting really been running. We provide leads for realtors only in the US and Canada. Mhmm.\n\nAnd within the last few months, it's just scaled to, a level in which I actually didn't think I'd hit until probably probably that was in my three year plan.\n\nSo yeah, it was What was the the three year plan?\n\nSo the three year plan, was to be able to consistently sign, ten thousand pounds worth sort of ten thousand dollars worth of clients every week. Wow.\n\nWe're now on a Monday again, and I've signed another.\n\nSo So we we basically, in essence, helped you do what you wanted to do in three years and three months.\n\nYeah. That's awesome, man. So you you picked everything up properly really in July. So you had July, August, September and obviously October.\n\nSo that's a four month process, which is fantastic. And so you weren't always in the realtor space, were you? Where were you before coaching me? No.\n\nSo I was one of the many, one of the mass, that saw a ecommerce boom ecommerce agency boom. So I had an ecommerce store, went on to do quite well with from it. And how we worked out was when it all came to when it went south, which they all do, dropshipping stores and things like that. So what happened is I thought, I can do the ads. I've done the ads myself. Why don't I start up a marketing agency? Yep.\n\nI thought signing a client would be easiest thing you'll ever do.\n\nTurns out it wasn't, and I spent sort of from November to probably April Yep.\n\nJust reaching out to thousands of brands.\n\nI had no real structure.\n\nI had no real offer.\n\nI had nothing, and it makes sense why it didn't work.\n\nBut, yeah, now we're I then went on to sign off the calls, jump in, be a part of it. And, then I basically said, look. I need to really get my head right. I really need to make sure that I know what what the best plan for me is.\n\nAnd how I done that was I said, what's what niche should I do?\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd within about four minutes, if that seconds, it was it was decided.\n\nYep.\n\nAnd at the start, I thought, bollocks. This isn't good.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut, actually, and and, actually, up until about five weeks ago, I thought the same thing. So Yeah. I can't really and even now, I'm not sure. You know, like, you can never I don't think I don't think I'll ever be too sure. But, yeah, I'm I'm now really enjoying it. I'm loving it.\n\nYeah. Because I was I was gonna mention because, obviously, like, when you joined us, the the thing you was lacking was the strategy and the the the actual proper process or the updated version of of outreach and everything like that. But what what I think we found with you specifically and the problem that we had to overcome was that sort of mental one of that sort of always looking for something that's a little bit better or always looking for the greener grass when in reality it's sort of just sticking to that one thing. Now, you mentioned earlier, like obviously you were doing thousands and thousands of reach reaching out to brands and stuff in the e com space.\n\nAnd that's true for a lot of agencies. And it's a painful, painful problem that I'm sure people watching this video right now resonate with When you came on board with us, what what do you think were the main things that you learned that allowed you to sort of think, okay, I've actually now got a new because it was quite a lot. It's it's a big transformation, but if you could sort of summarize it in a couple of things, not to put you on the spot.\n\nThe main thing, it was actually having people around me who weren't just who haven't just sort of taken money and gone.\n\nRight.\n\nFrom from again, here was some like you, Beau, and, actually, everyone in there.\n\nEveryone chats. We talk pretty much daily.\n\nYeah. If if someone puts a a question in the group, normally, someone will beat you to the reply. You You know? There's always someone to help.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd that was a great start.\n\nThem call we have calls on a Tuesday and a Friday. They're another because that was huge. Yep. And Loom Alchemy.\n\nYeah.\n\nWe have to say Loom Alchemy.\n\nYeah. To give to give everyone context is did you tell me why don't you explain in in your own words what Lume alchemy is?\n\nIt's a module we have in the program, but if you were to put it yeah, it it's a module in the program which has, basically taken me from zero to everything now because I have followed it. We have all followed it, and I genuinely don't think there's one person who doesn't get sort of one to four Meetings a day.\n\nReplies slash meetings. I I'm probably three meetings a day from it.\n\nI know a lot of others. Some people are doing far more. Some people are doing less. But everyone's working on consistent meetings. And, it's it's, the most personalized, unpersonalized outreach in the world.\n\nYeah. Like the most automated, but also personalized.\n\nYou know, I think it's an interesting one because when we were building that, our philosophy was like, people, when it comes to outreach is they have this sort of belief where it has to be quality or it has to be quantity. Like, you can't have both is what people thought. And we looked at that, and we were like, fuck that. Like, you know, we should just combine the two. And I think that's probably why it works quite well.\n\nAnd obviously that that's proven that it does. Yeah.\n\nThree meetings a day and, you know, for like some agency owners, they they'd be happy with the meeting a day.\n\nAnd so now that, now that you're in the position where ten ks weeks and two to three client weeks feel normal to you, where do you see yourself going next? Not only with what we have in the program, but also because it's obviously that it's a very new feeling novelty for you to have this level of growth.\n\nBut what do you think is next for you?\n\nScaling.\n\nI've proven to myself that I can do it. That's one of the huge parts. It's a great question as well because I actually thought about it Friday Friday afternoon when I was finishing work.\n\nYep.\n\nWhen I was wrapping everything up, I thought, what now? This was the goal.\n\nThis was the goal.\n\nIt's like we did it's like my three year goal has been realized.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd then I thought, actually, now I need to do this every week and double it and double it again and double it again, and then just build my team out, build out just and and, actually, I think service delivery, I wanna get everything down to such a great, such nothing's ever perfect. I get it. But so near to perfection that, I I could happily sort of be able to go away for a day or not work. I have such a great team behind me that they will close every all the sales. They but that I think that's now the the next step. Mhmm.\n\nBecause, obviously, that's we we have the service delivery module in the program, which we released today, which I think will be there for you. And, like, the the reason we've done that is because we what we found with a lot of clients like your situation now is we once we solve the appointment booking and sales problem and the dilemma that comes with not having clients, you're then like, okay. What's next? And I feel like most people who who coach, not to name any names, but as you you've experienced before, and I'm sure everybody else watching this has experienced before, you've bought nine nine seven programs or slightly higher ticket programs from people on Instagram or YouTube, and their courses just aren't up to scratch. What what do you feel is different between what you the value you've received from us and the processes we've given you and the courses that you've seen beforehand? What would you say are the differences, or how would you describe that?\n\nQuite one, because it's actually solely down to one thing, and it's we build our own agencies. You know, there's a hundred at the time of today, I think there's a hundred and seventeen people in the course.\n\nYep.\n\nI would say a hundred and seventeen people have their own agency.\n\nNo one copies each other. Isn't that there was never a script?\n\nThere was never one set email line and then this and then this, and you build it all out yourself, but you use proven methods that that I would say are the best as well to be had to say. But, and I I've done various courses, and I've never I've never got any traction. I've never been able to really get there.\n\nBut, actually, marketing where Yeah.\n\nI'm we're we're doing our own testing, split testing emails with this and this. And there there there's so many different tests, and we're doing Facebook, and we're doing LinkedIn, and we're doing but this is all off of our own back, but it's also what we've been taught. Yeah. So it's like, We've actually built our own agencies.\n\nThis is the difference. There is no copy and pasting. There is no yeah. I think the only copy and pasting is their website.\n\nBut I didn't even use it.\n\nNo.\n\nYou can get away with with the website. And I think this is a common a common dilemma with agency coaching programs or usually lack thereof in the coaching. There's not much of that at all.\n\nBut, like, you know, what happens is someone puts together something in Teachable over the course of a month, and they sell it, and then they just don't update it. But we've and I think this is as you've just described, the process we try to follow is to teach you the principles. I would rather, like you know the whole phrase, like, give a man a fish, feed him for a day, teach a man to fish, feed him for a lifetime?\n\nYeah.\n\nI think what we try to do at the program is give you the tools, like because what what's gonna work on a module for next year, and I'm not sure if you're aware of this or not, on, like, how we actually the the the critical thought process that we go through to build the systems.\n\nAnd, like, because, obviously, at the moment, you've got the program and you can pull apart different lessons and come up with your own methods which you've done and which are working for you. And that the reason you're doing so well is because you've taken it upon yourself to do that, and we set the expectation that that's what needs to be done. But in the future we quite like to have like this is our process for coming up with copy. This is our process for testing. This is exact. And I think that that's the main thing because otherwise, you've just got two hundred, three hundred thousand people all singing the same song, and it sucks.\n\nAnd that is what most of it is. Yeah. And I hate to say it, but the amount of emails I get, which are, this is new or Yeah. It's bright. Like, I had one the other day. It was a it was a it's a breath of fresh air to see you're not all the same, and I thought that was hilarious.\n\nThen we've even started doing what the the Facebook outreach, and it's just completely different. It's my I've switched my phone off, but it was like I sent it over to you. It wasn't it was crazy. It was like, wow.\n\nThis is the best I've ever seen. And because of that, I'll book a call with you. Yeah. I've actually got a call after this call.\n\nSo Yeah.\n\nIt is it is, yeah, it is such a great feeling. You know? And, and I I personally I know people say, like, yeah, you get used to it. I don't I don't think I will just for the simple fact of I can't I enjoy getting on the calls.\n\nSo, I know a lot of people dread it. You're the same sort of mind as I am, but I actually enjoy getting on the calls. And this is, I think, one of the benefits of of being able to do this and and being able to book so many calls is that my day is just so much better. It's so much better than it ever was.\n\nThat's awesome, man. And so just going back to what you were saying before, about building your own systems and stuff, what do you feel is a couple of one of one or two of the main parts of the program that have taught you to think of yourself?\n\nAre there any sort of obviously, I'm putting you on the spot here and Yeah.\n\nWhen you're writing with your own scripts, with your own script, we have there's different ways of sour scripts, and you basically build your own. Mhmm.\n\nYou have building your own team, building that system out, building your own sales scripts.\n\nAnd it comes down to the little things like on the Louvre alchemy, the the wording, the, I would just say on a whole, you could without even without having to bring in a new module, I think that you could quite simply systemize and scale the business by any business because I know that there are a few people who are coaches, for instance, in it, and and I'm sure they're still using it.\n\nAnd I I think it's become if you really just work if you just do it, it will work. And I think everyone in there has seen that.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat actually, when you really do it and and I've went and got VAs, and I went and got this, and I went and got even down to that, I had VAs working before. And it was never they were always it was come and go, come and go. Yeah. Now I have one I'm more than one VA, but I have people doing specific outreach and get getting leads. And they've been with me since August, and they're not going anywhere.\n\nNo revolving door, but Yeah. Since this Yeah.\n\nAnd it's really building out the team. Like, my everything.\n\nEverything for it. Everything about it is just it allows you to simply scale, and and boost, I think, everyone in there is going.\n\nYeah. When you when you look at Imperium Agency and the the business we have, where do you in in relation to the other people in the market and the competition, eighteen, twenty four months from now, where do you think we would be based on the product and your experience with us so far?\n\nI think you'll have about fifteen hundred to two thousand students to say the least.\n\nYeah. A hundred percent. Well, if everyone all it comes down to is also whether people are willing to really go and give money and to benefit themselves. Mhmm. I get it. Not everyone can, but I would say I would put well, now if I was to if I if I was to have had the money, now is all the money I had, and I couldn't do anything else six months ago, and you just told me now, then I would have obviously put every penny I had down.\n\nAnd I'm back and buying Bitcoin if you could.\n\nYeah. I would have got everything. I would have just been at I would have just done everything I could to get it. But, yeah, it's it's because now it's, now I've got it. Yeah.\n\nActually, it's benefit me far more than anything else ever.\n\nI think you should give yourself a lot of the credit because of how hard you've worked and how much you've applied yourself and controlled your mind and just actually done the damn thing, which is which is good. Good thing.\n\nWell, yeah, I've also found it quite fun, the whole experience. That was that was a huge thing as well. It wasn't there's no it wasn't tedious, and there are I'm not gonna even deny it. There are some parts of the course, but videos that I haven't watched because it wasn't the right one for me, and it was something that I knew. But Yeah. Everything I've watched has been a everything I've watched has been very valuable for me, to me. And and, yeah, it's worked.\n\nAnd Papifima. And so once again, just to describe your situation before you came on board with us. So you're in a niche that wasn't really taking you anywhere. You were sending, you know, hundreds, if not well, you were literally sending thousands of outreach messages to get no appointments, but I can imagine that as demotivating.\n\nYou You probably felt like you wanted to give up on the agency. You felt like you'd lost faith in mentors, and you just thought that it was just difficult and hard.\n\nTo people in that situation, what advice would you give them knowing what you know now? And you're not only by the course.\n\nNo.\n\nDon't trust everything you see, because there's a lot of people who will tell you they're doing one and they're not.\n\nAnd, realistically, it's actually just do the fucking work. I never would.\n\nI never would, and I would always try and outsource it.\n\nAnd in this case, I didn't have a choice. I had to do it. Yeah. I used to get a VA and say, like, come up with drone script.\n\nLike, of course, it didn't work.\n\nYeah.\n\nNo no one's saying that's never gonna work.\n\nYeah.\n\nWhereas now, I'm I'm updating it almost daily, spit testing it.\n\nGot a lady in the calls called Alba, and she came up with some phenomenal content, which I have to actually say is is that email alone.\n\nWhat's all got me in my last four clients?\n\nYeah. Yeah. This is the thing. It's like that's why the commute is so awesome because people come up with shit, and they're like, oh, guys. This might work.\n\nAnd we've got it in such a nice sort of, like because when both And Jamie.\n\nAnd Jamie as well. Yeah. I mean, when we when we started it, we we didn't really anticipate the culture being as active and, like, altruistic as we did. We just, you know, because you you'd expect if you've because I know you talked to some guys we've got who are also in the realtor space, and you share ideas and strategy. Yeah. And it's nice that that culture has has come about because of the you know, a lot of people try and keep their cards close to their chest, but being able to give and take with people who are solving the same problems as you is is infinitely valuable. And, Yeah.\n\nWe're we're in London. So the one of the other ones who's in, the realtor space, I went for dinner with him a little while ago. I I might as well be in an office with him because we're actually just on FaceTime to each other all day long.\n\nSo it it it that you know, like, yeah, there is genuine people in here, and it's not just people in all over the world who never speak to every everything's mine mine mine.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt's like we're in the same niche. We're we're trying to get the same clients, but we both help each other out. Like, I set something up for him the other day. He's he's abroad, so I set up some new emails.\n\nJust vice versa. You know? Like, we we shouldn't be helping each other. Yeah. But we're all we will understand that if you're trying to argue over ten clients in a niche where you've got a hundred and fifty thousand of them Yeah. You're doing something seriously wrong.\n\nYeah. It's the same thing when we take on because, obviously, our agency works at gyms, and quite a few of Imperium people work with gyms. People are like, what the hell are you doing? Like, you're helping your competition. It's like, dude, there's, like, seventy thousand gyms.\n\nIf we find if we find a guy who wants to work with twenty gyms, there's a spit in the ocean. It's like, it doesn't make a difference, and, and being able to to offer that help is is useful, man. Luca, mate, it's been an absolute pleasure. I think we both have to go for sales calls now conveniently.\n\nYeah. But in in closing, if if you were if you were watching this, as someone who used to be in your situation, who was thinking, oh, that program sounds kinda cool. What would you say to them about the program in, you know, at that point? Just curious.\n\nDo it.\n\nYou you you will be head busting the wall until you buy this because you you will do the same thing wrong again and again and again, and there is nothing that will teach you to do something right. And, actually, this has taught me what to do right, how to do it, but it's also allowed me to teach myself.\n\nSo if it was my old self, I'd just say just buy the fucking cool stuff here. Stop being an idiot. You can you've you've seen into the future. You know what's gonna happen.\n\nSo Yeah, man.\n\nAwesome. Well, listen. I think we'll we'll wrap it up there. Greatly appreciate your time, and I'm looking forward to doing this, when you do you know, we'll do another one when you get to thirty k a week or something.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut when we hit six figures a month Yeah.\n\nWhen you hit that hundred k a month mark, which will probably happen a lot faster than you expect, because the the the most difficult thing is getting to ten k a month.\n\nOnce you get to ten k the fact you've got ten k a week as as quickly as you have, that's like I went from a month to a week.\n\nYeah. You're nice. Think support just you just skipped the month. You're like you're like, fuck that. It's too small. Just gonna skip it.\n\nDude, listen.\n\nI'll leave you to it, and, we can call it a day.\n\nSee you later.\n\nThanks for coming, brother.\n\nThank you, mate. Ciao. Bye bye."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}}, {});
