Today's interview is with Austin Hunt, an agency owner who joined us four months ago. And in those short four months, he has had a ten thousand dollars in new monthly revenue to his agency to his bottom line hundred k a year extra attributed to mindset shifts and appointment booking systems within easy ground. Which is awesome.\n\nNothing makes me happier than these videos and I'm so excited to share this one with you. Now, for transparency, this is obviously a pitch based video. Right? It's a marketing angle.\n\nIt's designed to get you to have enough confidence and conviction in the program and in me to book a call so you can buy my thing so I can make money. I'm be honest with my intentions here. The link to buy the thing is in the description. It's gonna help you get more clients, more customers, more freedom, financial freedom, more of what you want, less of what you've done.\n\nIt works incredibly well as it has for Austin. And if you do buy, you may end up on this channel talking about how great we are. How great would that be? Let's hop into the interview.\n\nI'm really excited for you to watch it. Alright, everyone. How's it going? And welcome back to another client interview.\n\nI have got the wonderful Austin Hunt here with his also wonderful background, which conveniently he set up, without being a YouTuber or anything. Austin, how's it going?\n\nIt's going good today. How's it going?\n\nOh, man. I'm so good. I'm always happy, especially when it comes to these results. So Austin has been with us since, I believe, it was February, so three to four months now. Joined when Easy Grow launched, making around ten k a month at the start. Three, four months later, he's now added six figures to his revenue, which is just pretty bloody awesome if you ask me. So So, Austin, why don't you just take a second to introduce yourself, tell people about who you are, what your agency does, and then we'll get into the details.\n\nYeah. I appreciate the introduction. So my name is Austin.\n\nI live out in Denver, Colorado, and, my agency is MooMark, MooMark Design. I'm actually in the middle of a rebrand, which is pretty exciting because my niche, things that I focus on is legal, specifically helping with lawyers and lead generation. Mhmm. So I'm I'm rebranding in May, to legal guardian, which is pretty exciting.\n\nI don't know how I got that DBA, but, fuck, I'll take it.\n\nYeah. I guess I like coffee. I like hiking and, just, like, pushing in life. You know?\n\nLove it. Amazing, man. So what we're gonna do here, for everyone watching is sort of we'll dive into where you were before you hopped into easy growing, and then we'll talk a little bit about what happened as a result of that. We'll stay clear of the how did this change your life in wonderful magical ways because it's pretty self explanatory when you add an extra ten k in hundred income.\n\nBut I would like to know, first of all, why you scheduled the call and where you were before working with us. What were the problems you were trying to solve? What were the pain points?\n\nThat'd be great to know.\n\nYeah. So before I scheduled the call, I mean, I'd seen your guys' YouTube videos for a while, actually, your YouTube videos for a while.\n\nAnd you can kinda tell when people's, like, people are, like, bullshitting and trying to sell something that they don't know. But I kinda felt that you had gone through a lot of the stuff that maybe I was going through, and looking at, like, how to improve your quality of life and how to push in life and how to help more people. And that's that's how I align, in in my mission.\n\nSo there was some resonance that was happening even before.\n\nAnd then I ended up booking a call because I just I realized that there's a lot of, like, darkness around client acquisition, and, it doesn't need to be hard. It that's what I how I viewed is, like, for some reason, this felt like an impossible task. And, you know, I'm I'm I even do SEO, and I know that progressing initially for a brand in SEO is just not a smart move, for most companies.\n\nAnd, man, I I guess I just want a public record with that. But you you need to have referrals coming in. You need to have a business coming in to support that type of effort. And so, yeah, I was just kind of in that place where I'm like, I just don't know what what it is from getting from nothing to, like, a lead. And in addition, I believe that people will figure this stuff out on, like, accident, and they become, like, salespeople for big agencies, and then they kinda hold it close to their chest.\n\nThey don't wanna tell people.\n\nYep. They're not transparent about it. So, yeah, I just wanted I I don't like having areas that I don't understand how to get into.\n\nAnd I'm like, if I can acquire new leads, as need be, then I can put myself in a less stressful place if a client does leave.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo that's that was my headspace. It's like, if if you can get that, then it's not a big deal.\n\nThat makes perfect sense. So before you're working with us, you're at the ten k month mark. And if I'm correct in thinking, to summarize that, so you built the business through referrals and through network to that sort of six figure mark.\n\nYou just wanted to sort of and and it would have continued to grow, but you wanted a, what you could even call psychological safety net, just where you know that you can get clients. And there's no massive rush to get them, but it's just knowing that you have that skill and knowing that it can be done. Because I think a lot of people join, and they believe that acquisition is hard.\n\nAnd then because they haven't got it figured out, and they haven't got the paradigm or the way of seeing it. So they ultimately just, like, don't get it, and then they hop in and they do. So so you came into the program, and, obviously, three months later, you're now at twenty k a month. So you've added a couple of clients, if I'm not mistaken with rather large retainers that we don't have to go into.\n\nBut how does your understanding of client acquisition differ now from before? Now what's changed in your mind? What are the big key things that you learned from Easy Grow that helped you change?\n\nYeah. So the first one is objection handling.\n\nThat's a pretty straightforward one, but I didn't realize that it was, like, subconsciously and and, like, also consciously, participating and throwing objections in front of my clients. Mhmm. And so, you know, maybe they want, like, someone in house. And then I'm like, well, if you want someone in house, I totally get that. You know?\n\nAnd what what that's done is just, like, why are they talking with me for an hour, and why am I bringing like, why am I allowing that to, like, stop me from progressing forward where a much stronger argument would be like, well, I see that you, in the past have hired someone in house, but how's that work for you? You know? Otherwise, you wouldn't be on this call.\n\nAnd I understand, like, the fear that's associated with, you know, hiring someone outside your staff. Right? But anyone that's very talented just wants their time back. So Mhmm.\n\nYou know, it's like, do you want results, or do you want someone that you can look over the shoulder? And so a lot of it was objection handling and also preventing objections on my own side before they even met, you know, met them. And then there was a lot of it was, like, mindset shit, mindset shift. And it's primarily yeah.\n\nIt's a mouthful.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd what I kinda found is that, there's this idea that this is really hard. And when we get ourselves in a position where things are, like, really hard to do, like, client acquisition being hard, it just puts this impossible barrier of, like, impossibility. Like, if it happens, it's like a fluke, and then you get really excited. And I didn't want that. I wanted at least to make it easier. I don't think anything in life is actually really easy, but I wanted to make it understandable. And I think this program really helped for me to get some psychological changes in my own mind.\n\nAnd from there, it was like, okay. Now that I know this, how can I put myself in a position with these new leads that I'm getting that I'm not actively, like, sabotaging my own success? And happened pretty quick. You know, I actually had to slow down the process a little bit because I you know, I'm in the process of hiring writers. So it's like, if I bring on, you know, ten k in business, I have to deliver that product, and that takes time. So, yeah, it's pretty cool.\n\nIt's amazing, man. So you're now in a position where you've kind of got a tap, where if you turn it on, you're gonna get clients. You're ultimately in control. Is am I right in thinking that? Like, if you wanted to did you said it yourself before this interview that you you don't have this massive desire to just blow the whole thing up, and then it's not very fun.\n\nWell, I do I do now. I just needed to get Yeah. But I didn't initially. Yeah. Yeah. Until I start to feel that.\n\nSo, basically, what you're saying, and I'm kinda putting words in your mouth here for my own self interest.\n\nSo That's okay.\n\nBut what you're saying is, like so Easy Grow has given you the ability to have a set of systems or a system whereby you can just go and turn the tap on, you get clients, you turn it off, hire writers, turn it on, get clients, turn it off, and that's been working. So you talked about the mindset part of it. So was that specifically with the first couple of modules in the program, like sales transcendence acquisition genesis, or was it throughout the rest of the program as well?\n\nYeah. It was actually first of all, it was, like, the YouTube videos that you post are really helpful. Mhmm. So it was bleeding into that. I was watching those, just kinda going through your archive while going through the initial part, of your program.\n\nAnd I was looking for, like, words of, like, understanding is, like, the term is it there's, like, sometimes people say things with, like, understanding. Maybe I should say, words of knowing. Sometimes people say things with, like, an understanding. Like, we can say we can both agree that taking care of your fitness is, like, healthy, and good for your life.\n\nBut some people understand that, and they don't know it. And then you see someone that knows it, and they say, take care of your fitness. Otherwise, you're gonna have really bad health late in life. And their actions, like, show that. And so within the first, I think, three modules, I got most of what I needed to get to hear.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd, it was just, like, these tiny little phrases that were written into the, you know, videos that just, like I was just, like, really paying attention, no distraction, you know, locked in, and I'm like, well, shit. Why don't I just give that a shot? Why Why don't I just try this out and see what happens? I mean, what what's the worst that's gonna happen?\n\nNothing. You know? Yeah. So, yeah, pretty quick.\n\nAwesome, dude. Fantastic. So I would like to know this. So you're now doing sort of multi six figures as opposed to six figures.\n\nObviously, you've got a pretty bright future ahead. What do you want to do next with the business, and how might you use Easy Grow to accomplish that?\n\nYeah. So that's a really good question.\n\nSo I got to the point. I think this is, like, a a number that's, like, really helpful if you're out on your own, which about is about twenty k a month. That was what was given to me by some of my close friends who are entrepreneurs and grinders themselves.\n\nThat's where you can kinda take care of your own means, take care of your family, and it and that that has been true for me. You know, I don't have to, like, focus so much on my bank account anymore.\n\nAnd in that headspace, it's allowed me to take a step back and say, like, well, what type of impact do I wanna have? Like, what's going on in the world? You know? What do I like?\n\nWhat do I not like? And I'm a big proponent of, like, meditating, so I, like, meditated on that quite a bit. And where I'm progressing now is, I work with lawyers, and, I don't think that lawyers are all bad. Some of them are, just like everyone else.\n\nAnd a cool soul, mate.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nYep.\n\nAnd, in America, we have, like, a lot of issues with, like, overreaching government sometimes, overreaching insurance agencies. And And so I realized, like, you know what? That's what lawyers are for. They're like a last line of defense for the people.\n\nMhmm. So I'm launching, relaunching, Legal Guardian, which is my company's used to be called MooMark, but no one can say it, and it's not niched. And now I'm finally ready to, like, niche. You know?\n\nAnd I wanna help the right lawyers.\n\nI don't I don't have to You don't have to take accounts you don't want.\n\nIs that right?\n\nExactly.\n\nIt's like if I bring abundance, and I have been able to to a law firm, that's gonna have impact on, like, maybe a thousand people in ten years, if not more.\n\nSo if you pick someone that's like a dirtbag, you know, that's gonna impact a thousand people backwards, in a negative way. And so, yeah, my goal is to, help change the legal system in America, without a PhD, which I think is kind of a fun problem. Mhmm.\n\nAnd I'm working right now on connecting to Harvard to get some writers, from, like, the, you know, the graduate students, the PhD students, which I think would be pretty fun, or the JDs, I guess, as they're called, technically.\n\nAnd, yeah, I just wanna make some impact. You know?\n\nAmazing, man.\n\nIt's it's fun stuff when you I think it's easier to, like, dream bigger when you have your needs met.\n\nYeah. This is so I was literally stole the words out of my mouth. I was about to ask you this because you talked to a brief second ago about, you alluded to financial freedom where now you've done what you've done. You've built the systems.\n\nYou've got the clients, done the program, blah blah blah. Now you're doing twenty grand a month. You you can start to think. What do I actually want?\n\nBecause I no longer need to have enough money to take care of my family, pay my rent, Uber, wherever I want, whatever that looks like. So that gives you the opportunity.\n\nI think a lot of people get stuck with this because they they get to, like, ten k a month, twenty k.\n\nBefore that, they they they can't really, like, create a meaningful goal because they can't put food on the table. So once you get past that point, then it's great. So do you travel a lot, like, financial freedom wise, or are you just pretty set on one location?\n\nYeah. So until I got to that point, I'm I'm kind of like a how do I word it? I feel like things have to be earned in my life. Mhmm. So I kinda restricted myself until I got to certain places.\n\nI'm actually going to the Bahamas here in June. That should be Levon. Yeah.\n\nI gotta eat something, I think, Conch is how you say it.\n\nI didn't know I didn't know that that was, like, a hub for pirates back in the day.\n\nSo maybe yeah. Who knew? It's like this random random kind of island. I wanna go to Germany back in, in, like, September. Probably go to Oktoberfest.\n\nYeah. So definitely want travel. You know, a lot of it is, like, getting not just the money, the finance wise, but, like, locking in systems with clients. Mhmm. So I I'm kinda like you, as far as, like, I can tell with, like, lean operations.\n\nYes. It's just me making this money right now, and I've been able to do it through a combination of AI training, and just, like, persistence and figuring out what it actually takes to be successful, not, like, all this other shit that people do to run their wheels. So No. Yeah. Definitely travel. Travel is really important. I think it opens your mind up.\n\nPlus it's like, you you know, you got one swing on this planet.\n\nYou might as well I'm right.\n\nGet up every fucking location you can.\n\nYep. See the world, man. So one final thing, and this is obviously, a little bit typical of a of a sales client interview. If you were talking talking to let's say someone was thinking about buying the program, thinking about scheduling a call, but they're on the fence, what would you say to them?\n\nYeah. I think it's okay to be on the fence on offense. It means that you're thinking about something.\n\nA lot of times, they believe that, we know if something's a good fit for us, and we also know when it's not. So if, you know, if it's not a good fit, then you just shouldn't do it. There's no reason to, like, worry about it.\n\nBut if it is a good fit Please don't buy it if it's not a good fit, by the way.\n\nYeah. More way way more bad than good.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And and it's just it's not like to take it away. It's just, like, we know it. I think we really do know what's usually pretty good for us. So if it's something that you believe is good for us and it's just a money thing, it's never bad to invest in yourself.\n\nAnd you'll definitely walk away with new knowledge, which is really valuable, and becoming, like, a stronger person in life mentally, physically, education wise, logical wise is a very valuable thing that, I believe something that I forget the the gentleman that said it, but until you're making a hundred, like, until you're making a million a year, you need to invest on yourself.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nYou need to be making yourself, more valuable, stronger, like, smarter, whatever that may be. So I would say take a moment. If you're on the fence, totally fine to be on the fence. It means that you are actually interested in making a smart decision.\n\nI would turn towards yourself first before your friends.\n\nGo sit, meditate, go for a walk, get get away from distractions, and ask yourself a very, like, like, serious but, like, very easy fundamental question.\n\nWhy do I feel resistance on buying this? And if the resistance that you feel is that you may become the person that you're scared to become, then, you know, fucking do it.\n\nLike You've been in the mindset training, the right man.\n\nYeah. I need Thank you. Yeah. It's just and if you're listening to this and you know you should do it, but you're like, I don't know if I should, just, like, fucking do it. Like, you know what I mean?\n\nI think a lot of people Just go for it.\n\nA lot of people don't make the decision to do it because it would result in their current sense of self suffering. Because it's like, maybe they're doing, like, couple grand a month. They wanna get to six figures. They know the program can do that. But by buying the program, now they've gotta do some work.\n\nLike, you know, you invest their money. You you gotta you know what I mean? Like, you you buy it, and now you gotta do some work. Like, that's the other thing. Like, don't buy it if you haven't got the work ethic to see it through. I'm sure you can tell everyone that, you know, the program's not for the faint hearted. It's not it's not an easy sort of solution where you just watch a couple of videos and then out of nowhere, you know, it takes years, in your case, months of hard work.\n\nBut I think I think that pretty much sums up everything that I wanted to cover.\n\nI'm really, really grateful for you hopping in, and, maybe we could do another one of these in three to six months when you're even further ahead.\n\nBut, dude, I appreciate you. How can people find you, man? Is there any way any way personal brand shit going on, or do you what what you're saying there?\n\nYeah. Right now, I'm actually off of social media, which is really nice.\n\nFor you, ma'am.\n\nI love it.\n\nSo you can find me, at legal guardian dot I o.\n\nIt it's not fully launched yet, but it will be in, end of May. So that's exciting. Cool. And then also on LinkedIn, I I use LinkedIn for good business connections and people who are like minded. So if you have questions on this stuff, just, like, reach out to me. You know, I'll jump on a call.\n\nSuper kind. Super kind. Be careful what you wish for, man, because you might have quite a lot of people asking.\n\nThat's okay. You know, I could I could just always, like, ban my LinkedIn and, like, be a permanent on a rock, you know.\n\nThere are worse problems to have. There are. Yeah. We'll call it there, man. Thank you so much, and, I'll see you again in the future.\n\nThanks, Charlie.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/11lr4xt6ld?autoplay=0&wmode=transparent&wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

Today's interview is with Austin Hunt, an agency owner who joined us four months ago. And in those short four months, he has had a ten thousand dollars in new monthly revenue to his agency to his bottom line hundred k a year extra attributed to mindset shifts and appointment booking systems within easy ground. Which is awesome.\n\nNothing makes me happier than these videos and I'm so excited to share this one with you. Now, for transparency, this is obviously a pitch based video. Right? It's a marketing angle.\n\nIt's designed to get you to have enough confidence and conviction in the program and in me to book a call so you can buy my thing so I can make money. I'm be honest with my intentions here. The link to buy the thing is in the description. It's gonna help you get more clients, more customers, more freedom, financial freedom, more of what you want, less of what you've done.\n\nIt works incredibly well as it has for Austin. And if you do buy, you may end up on this channel talking about how great we are. How great would that be? Let's hop into the interview.\n\nI'm really excited for you to watch it. Alright, everyone. How's it going? And welcome back to another client interview.\n\nI have got the wonderful Austin Hunt here with his also wonderful background, which conveniently he set up, without being a YouTuber or anything. Austin, how's it going?\n\nIt's going good today. How's it going?\n\nOh, man. I'm so good. I'm always happy, especially when it comes to these results. So Austin has been with us since, I believe, it was February, so three to four months now. Joined when Easy Grow launched, making around ten k a month at the start. Three, four months later, he's now added six figures to his revenue, which is just pretty bloody awesome if you ask me. So So, Austin, why don't you just take a second to introduce yourself, tell people about who you are, what your agency does, and then we'll get into the details.\n\nYeah. I appreciate the introduction. So my name is Austin.\n\nI live out in Denver, Colorado, and, my agency is MooMark, MooMark Design. I'm actually in the middle of a rebrand, which is pretty exciting because my niche, things that I focus on is legal, specifically helping with lawyers and lead generation. Mhmm. So I'm I'm rebranding in May, to legal guardian, which is pretty exciting.\n\nI don't know how I got that DBA, but, fuck, I'll take it.\n\nYeah. I guess I like coffee. I like hiking and, just, like, pushing in life. You know?\n\nLove it. Amazing, man. So what we're gonna do here, for everyone watching is sort of we'll dive into where you were before you hopped into easy growing, and then we'll talk a little bit about what happened as a result of that. We'll stay clear of the how did this change your life in wonderful magical ways because it's pretty self explanatory when you add an extra ten k in hundred income.\n\nBut I would like to know, first of all, why you scheduled the call and where you were before working with us. What were the problems you were trying to solve? What were the pain points?\n\nThat'd be great to know.\n\nYeah. So before I scheduled the call, I mean, I'd seen your guys' YouTube videos for a while, actually, your YouTube videos for a while.\n\nAnd you can kinda tell when people's, like, people are, like, bullshitting and trying to sell something that they don't know. But I kinda felt that you had gone through a lot of the stuff that maybe I was going through, and looking at, like, how to improve your quality of life and how to push in life and how to help more people. And that's that's how I align, in in my mission.\n\nSo there was some resonance that was happening even before.\n\nAnd then I ended up booking a call because I just I realized that there's a lot of, like, darkness around client acquisition, and, it doesn't need to be hard. It that's what I how I viewed is, like, for some reason, this felt like an impossible task. And, you know, I'm I'm I even do SEO, and I know that progressing initially for a brand in SEO is just not a smart move, for most companies.\n\nAnd, man, I I guess I just want a public record with that. But you you need to have referrals coming in. You need to have a business coming in to support that type of effort. And so, yeah, I was just kind of in that place where I'm like, I just don't know what what it is from getting from nothing to, like, a lead. And in addition, I believe that people will figure this stuff out on, like, accident, and they become, like, salespeople for big agencies, and then they kinda hold it close to their chest.\n\nThey don't wanna tell people.\n\nYep. They're not transparent about it. So, yeah, I just wanted I I don't like having areas that I don't understand how to get into.\n\nAnd I'm like, if I can acquire new leads, as need be, then I can put myself in a less stressful place if a client does leave.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo that's that was my headspace. It's like, if if you can get that, then it's not a big deal.\n\nThat makes perfect sense. So before you're working with us, you're at the ten k month mark. And if I'm correct in thinking, to summarize that, so you built the business through referrals and through network to that sort of six figure mark.\n\nYou just wanted to sort of and and it would have continued to grow, but you wanted a, what you could even call psychological safety net, just where you know that you can get clients. And there's no massive rush to get them, but it's just knowing that you have that skill and knowing that it can be done. Because I think a lot of people join, and they believe that acquisition is hard.\n\nAnd then because they haven't got it figured out, and they haven't got the paradigm or the way of seeing it. So they ultimately just, like, don't get it, and then they hop in and they do. So so you came into the program, and, obviously, three months later, you're now at twenty k a month. So you've added a couple of clients, if I'm not mistaken with rather large retainers that we don't have to go into.\n\nBut how does your understanding of client acquisition differ now from before? Now what's changed in your mind? What are the big key things that you learned from Easy Grow that helped you change?\n\nYeah. So the first one is objection handling.\n\nThat's a pretty straightforward one, but I didn't realize that it was, like, subconsciously and and, like, also consciously, participating and throwing objections in front of my clients. Mhmm. And so, you know, maybe they want, like, someone in house. And then I'm like, well, if you want someone in house, I totally get that. You know?\n\nAnd what what that's done is just, like, why are they talking with me for an hour, and why am I bringing like, why am I allowing that to, like, stop me from progressing forward where a much stronger argument would be like, well, I see that you, in the past have hired someone in house, but how's that work for you? You know? Otherwise, you wouldn't be on this call.\n\nAnd I understand, like, the fear that's associated with, you know, hiring someone outside your staff. Right? But anyone that's very talented just wants their time back. So Mhmm.\n\nYou know, it's like, do you want results, or do you want someone that you can look over the shoulder? And so a lot of it was objection handling and also preventing objections on my own side before they even met, you know, met them. And then there was a lot of it was, like, mindset shit, mindset shift. And it's primarily yeah.\n\nIt's a mouthful.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd what I kinda found is that, there's this idea that this is really hard. And when we get ourselves in a position where things are, like, really hard to do, like, client acquisition being hard, it just puts this impossible barrier of, like, impossibility. Like, if it happens, it's like a fluke, and then you get really excited. And I didn't want that. I wanted at least to make it easier. I don't think anything in life is actually really easy, but I wanted to make it understandable. And I think this program really helped for me to get some psychological changes in my own mind.\n\nAnd from there, it was like, okay. Now that I know this, how can I put myself in a position with these new leads that I'm getting that I'm not actively, like, sabotaging my own success? And happened pretty quick. You know, I actually had to slow down the process a little bit because I you know, I'm in the process of hiring writers. So it's like, if I bring on, you know, ten k in business, I have to deliver that product, and that takes time. So, yeah, it's pretty cool.\n\nIt's amazing, man. So you're now in a position where you've kind of got a tap, where if you turn it on, you're gonna get clients. You're ultimately in control. Is am I right in thinking that? Like, if you wanted to did you said it yourself before this interview that you you don't have this massive desire to just blow the whole thing up, and then it's not very fun.\n\nWell, I do I do now. I just needed to get Yeah. But I didn't initially. Yeah. Yeah. Until I start to feel that.\n\nSo, basically, what you're saying, and I'm kinda putting words in your mouth here for my own self interest.\n\nSo That's okay.\n\nBut what you're saying is, like so Easy Grow has given you the ability to have a set of systems or a system whereby you can just go and turn the tap on, you get clients, you turn it off, hire writers, turn it on, get clients, turn it off, and that's been working. So you talked about the mindset part of it. So was that specifically with the first couple of modules in the program, like sales transcendence acquisition genesis, or was it throughout the rest of the program as well?\n\nYeah. It was actually first of all, it was, like, the YouTube videos that you post are really helpful. Mhmm. So it was bleeding into that. I was watching those, just kinda going through your archive while going through the initial part, of your program.\n\nAnd I was looking for, like, words of, like, understanding is, like, the term is it there's, like, sometimes people say things with, like, understanding. Maybe I should say, words of knowing. Sometimes people say things with, like, an understanding. Like, we can say we can both agree that taking care of your fitness is, like, healthy, and good for your life.\n\nBut some people understand that, and they don't know it. And then you see someone that knows it, and they say, take care of your fitness. Otherwise, you're gonna have really bad health late in life. And their actions, like, show that. And so within the first, I think, three modules, I got most of what I needed to get to hear.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd, it was just, like, these tiny little phrases that were written into the, you know, videos that just, like I was just, like, really paying attention, no distraction, you know, locked in, and I'm like, well, shit. Why don't I just give that a shot? Why Why don't I just try this out and see what happens? I mean, what what's the worst that's gonna happen?\n\nNothing. You know? Yeah. So, yeah, pretty quick.\n\nAwesome, dude. Fantastic. So I would like to know this. So you're now doing sort of multi six figures as opposed to six figures.\n\nObviously, you've got a pretty bright future ahead. What do you want to do next with the business, and how might you use Easy Grow to accomplish that?\n\nYeah. So that's a really good question.\n\nSo I got to the point. I think this is, like, a a number that's, like, really helpful if you're out on your own, which about is about twenty k a month. That was what was given to me by some of my close friends who are entrepreneurs and grinders themselves.\n\nThat's where you can kinda take care of your own means, take care of your family, and it and that that has been true for me. You know, I don't have to, like, focus so much on my bank account anymore.\n\nAnd in that headspace, it's allowed me to take a step back and say, like, well, what type of impact do I wanna have? Like, what's going on in the world? You know? What do I like?\n\nWhat do I not like? And I'm a big proponent of, like, meditating, so I, like, meditated on that quite a bit. And where I'm progressing now is, I work with lawyers, and, I don't think that lawyers are all bad. Some of them are, just like everyone else.\n\nAnd a cool soul, mate.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nYep.\n\nAnd, in America, we have, like, a lot of issues with, like, overreaching government sometimes, overreaching insurance agencies. And And so I realized, like, you know what? That's what lawyers are for. They're like a last line of defense for the people.\n\nMhmm. So I'm launching, relaunching, Legal Guardian, which is my company's used to be called MooMark, but no one can say it, and it's not niched. And now I'm finally ready to, like, niche. You know?\n\nAnd I wanna help the right lawyers.\n\nI don't I don't have to You don't have to take accounts you don't want.\n\nIs that right?\n\nExactly.\n\nIt's like if I bring abundance, and I have been able to to a law firm, that's gonna have impact on, like, maybe a thousand people in ten years, if not more.\n\nSo if you pick someone that's like a dirtbag, you know, that's gonna impact a thousand people backwards, in a negative way. And so, yeah, my goal is to, help change the legal system in America, without a PhD, which I think is kind of a fun problem. Mhmm.\n\nAnd I'm working right now on connecting to Harvard to get some writers, from, like, the, you know, the graduate students, the PhD students, which I think would be pretty fun, or the JDs, I guess, as they're called, technically.\n\nAnd, yeah, I just wanna make some impact. You know?\n\nAmazing, man.\n\nIt's it's fun stuff when you I think it's easier to, like, dream bigger when you have your needs met.\n\nYeah. This is so I was literally stole the words out of my mouth. I was about to ask you this because you talked to a brief second ago about, you alluded to financial freedom where now you've done what you've done. You've built the systems.\n\nYou've got the clients, done the program, blah blah blah. Now you're doing twenty grand a month. You you can start to think. What do I actually want?\n\nBecause I no longer need to have enough money to take care of my family, pay my rent, Uber, wherever I want, whatever that looks like. So that gives you the opportunity.\n\nI think a lot of people get stuck with this because they they get to, like, ten k a month, twenty k.\n\nBefore that, they they they can't really, like, create a meaningful goal because they can't put food on the table. So once you get past that point, then it's great. So do you travel a lot, like, financial freedom wise, or are you just pretty set on one location?\n\nYeah. So until I got to that point, I'm I'm kind of like a how do I word it? I feel like things have to be earned in my life. Mhmm. So I kinda restricted myself until I got to certain places.\n\nI'm actually going to the Bahamas here in June. That should be Levon. Yeah.\n\nI gotta eat something, I think, Conch is how you say it.\n\nI didn't know I didn't know that that was, like, a hub for pirates back in the day.\n\nSo maybe yeah. Who knew? It's like this random random kind of island. I wanna go to Germany back in, in, like, September. Probably go to Oktoberfest.\n\nYeah. So definitely want travel. You know, a lot of it is, like, getting not just the money, the finance wise, but, like, locking in systems with clients. Mhmm. So I I'm kinda like you, as far as, like, I can tell with, like, lean operations.\n\nYes. It's just me making this money right now, and I've been able to do it through a combination of AI training, and just, like, persistence and figuring out what it actually takes to be successful, not, like, all this other shit that people do to run their wheels. So No. Yeah. Definitely travel. Travel is really important. I think it opens your mind up.\n\nPlus it's like, you you know, you got one swing on this planet.\n\nYou might as well I'm right.\n\nGet up every fucking location you can.\n\nYep. See the world, man. So one final thing, and this is obviously, a little bit typical of a of a sales client interview. If you were talking talking to let's say someone was thinking about buying the program, thinking about scheduling a call, but they're on the fence, what would you say to them?\n\nYeah. I think it's okay to be on the fence on offense. It means that you're thinking about something.\n\nA lot of times, they believe that, we know if something's a good fit for us, and we also know when it's not. So if, you know, if it's not a good fit, then you just shouldn't do it. There's no reason to, like, worry about it.\n\nBut if it is a good fit Please don't buy it if it's not a good fit, by the way.\n\nYeah. More way way more bad than good.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And and it's just it's not like to take it away. It's just, like, we know it. I think we really do know what's usually pretty good for us. So if it's something that you believe is good for us and it's just a money thing, it's never bad to invest in yourself.\n\nAnd you'll definitely walk away with new knowledge, which is really valuable, and becoming, like, a stronger person in life mentally, physically, education wise, logical wise is a very valuable thing that, I believe something that I forget the the gentleman that said it, but until you're making a hundred, like, until you're making a million a year, you need to invest on yourself.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nYou need to be making yourself, more valuable, stronger, like, smarter, whatever that may be. So I would say take a moment. If you're on the fence, totally fine to be on the fence. It means that you are actually interested in making a smart decision.\n\nI would turn towards yourself first before your friends.\n\nGo sit, meditate, go for a walk, get get away from distractions, and ask yourself a very, like, like, serious but, like, very easy fundamental question.\n\nWhy do I feel resistance on buying this? And if the resistance that you feel is that you may become the person that you're scared to become, then, you know, fucking do it.\n\nLike You've been in the mindset training, the right man.\n\nYeah. I need Thank you. Yeah. It's just and if you're listening to this and you know you should do it, but you're like, I don't know if I should, just, like, fucking do it. Like, you know what I mean?\n\nI think a lot of people Just go for it.\n\nA lot of people don't make the decision to do it because it would result in their current sense of self suffering. Because it's like, maybe they're doing, like, couple grand a month. They wanna get to six figures. They know the program can do that. But by buying the program, now they've gotta do some work.\n\nLike, you know, you invest their money. You you gotta you know what I mean? Like, you you buy it, and now you gotta do some work. Like, that's the other thing. Like, don't buy it if you haven't got the work ethic to see it through. I'm sure you can tell everyone that, you know, the program's not for the faint hearted. It's not it's not an easy sort of solution where you just watch a couple of videos and then out of nowhere, you know, it takes years, in your case, months of hard work.\n\nBut I think I think that pretty much sums up everything that I wanted to cover.\n\nI'm really, really grateful for you hopping in, and, maybe we could do another one of these in three to six months when you're even further ahead.\n\nBut, dude, I appreciate you. How can people find you, man? Is there any way any way personal brand shit going on, or do you what what you're saying there?\n\nYeah. Right now, I'm actually off of social media, which is really nice.\n\nFor you, ma'am.\n\nI love it.\n\nSo you can find me, at legal guardian dot I o.\n\nIt it's not fully launched yet, but it will be in, end of May. So that's exciting. Cool. And then also on LinkedIn, I I use LinkedIn for good business connections and people who are like minded. So if you have questions on this stuff, just, like, reach out to me. You know, I'll jump on a call.\n\nSuper kind. Super kind. Be careful what you wish for, man, because you might have quite a lot of people asking.\n\nThat's okay. You know, I could I could just always, like, ban my LinkedIn and, like, be a permanent on a rock, you know.\n\nThere are worse problems to have. There are. Yeah. We'll call it there, man. Thank you so much, and, I'll see you again in the future.\n\nThanks, Charlie."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}}, {});
