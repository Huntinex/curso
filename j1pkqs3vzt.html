How's it going? And welcome to another client interview. I've got a lot more of these ones lined up, so they're gonna be on the way.\n\nBut in this video, I interview Ryan Mack who is also a fellow YouTuber in the SMMA space. You may have heard of him before. His channel will be linked in the description. But Ryan, joined us back.\n\nSo now it's February when I'm recording this. Right? Ryan joined us on October the seventh, and by the middle of December, he was making ten thousand dollars a month. He started doing one thousand dollars a month with one client, and he joined us because he couldn't get any more clients.\n\nHe basically he had the sort of foundations of the business. He'd been through a couple of courses to start, but he just couldn't grow. So he came on board and, you know, basically fast forward two months. He went from one grand a month to ten grand a month.\n\nAnd in this video, he basically explains how he did it, how he used our program, and also the dark side of making that money and, like, you know, why it might not actually be, like, the best thing in the world. Basically, everything is revealed in the video. Ryan's a great guy. He's really quite a little bit, and I'm hoping that you can derive some value from this interview.\n\nNow, obviously, the intention of me making these videos is to help you. But, you know, with this one specifically, it's to actually introduce our program to you and potentially sell it to you. So there will be a link that you can click in the description that goes to a sales funnel that will ask you to book a call. I don't care if you click it or not.\n\nYou don't have to. But, ultimately, if you do want to grow your agency and you're struggling and you want more clients, then you can click it. Alright? And it's a funnel.\n\nIt's designed to sell you something for full transparency. I don't mind if you click it or not. Without further ado, let's hop into the interview. I hope you enjoy it, and I will see you soon.\n\nHave a good day.\n\nAlright, everybody. How's it going? And welcome back to another client interview. I don't get bored of doing these. I love them to bits. And today, I have the man, the myth, the legend, Ryan, with me. Ryan's a client of mine who's been working with me.\n\nSo now is February.\n\nRyan started in now is February. Ryan started in October. And by December, by Christmas time, you were making ten thousand dollars a month in your agency if I'm if I'm not mistaken. So, basically, Ryan went from one k a month to ten k a month or ten thousand six hundred dollars a month to be precise in about sixty days using the program, which is pretty cool. So we're interviewing him to find out what happened. But, Ryan, why don't you just take a second to introduce yourself and just, you know, who you are, what niche you're in, etcetera, etcetera.\n\nYeah. For sure. Yeah. My name is Ryan.\n\nI have been running a YouTube ads agency in the info product space. That's kind of I was kinda dabbling around, like, other services before I started. I think I was in content creation, but where I really started to scale was with YouTube ads, info products. And I, you know, document a little bit on online on my channel and stuff.\n\nBut, yeah, so that's basically what I've been doing. I also do, like, a little bit of funnel building for my clients. I think that's what made, you know, some of the, sale a little bit easier. It's like, when you, like, convince people that you can actually help them, like, get the results as opposed to, you know, just running ads for them.\n\nSo, yeah, that's what I've been doing, pretty much since then.\n\nCool. Amazing. So what what we're gonna do here, just so everyone's aware of the structure, is we'll take a look at sort of, like, where you were, where you are, what the future looks like. But before we go into any of that, that sort of, like, last, you know, two months timeline, what I'd like to know is why you started in the first place. What were you doing before you actually started your agency, before you signed your first client and and came on board with us?\n\nYeah. That that's funny because you can literally you can literally see exactly what I was doing before that because I was doing nothing on YouTube. I was trying to grow, like, like, a personal brand, but with, like, nothing to back it up. Right?\n\nI was talking about, like, some, like, personal development stuff, and, yeah, I had, like, four hundred subs when I for, like, like, over eight months of the work, which was pretty embarrassing. And I realized, like, you know, I was on that whole journey of entrepreneurship and whatever, but I had nothing to show for it because I actually moved out from, like I I left my hometown or my home city and moved, like, to the middle of nowhere. I was like, okay. I'm I was, like, in that I I was gonna do that, like, whole, like, you know, grind here.\n\nRight?\n\nYeah. Yeah. But I, like, I I had I had, like, I was, like, four months in. Had this YouTube channel with four hundred subs and no money coming in besides, like, my date job, obviously. But it was pretty I felt like shit. So I was like, am I on the cuss on these on these agendas? Yeah, mate.\n\nGo for it. Yeah. Yeah. You you go for it.\n\nThat's fine.\n\nYeah. So and then, like, in the middle of that, like, August, I was, okay, dude. I gotta start making money. Right?\n\nOtherwise, like, what am I doing? So then that's when I got, like, my first clients. That that first video, like, actually kinda popped off of my channel. I was like, let's just talk about SMMA, and then, like, it's, like, my biggest video by far now.\n\nBut Cool.\n\nBut the thing is I spent yeah. I I I was doing nothing, literally. I I wanna do something with my life, but, but YouTube wasn't Yeah. Cutting it for me at the time.\n\nYeah. Just just for context, Ryan actually has a YouTube channel where he sort of documented SMMA journey. It will be linked in the description so you guys can go and have a look at that one. So so you had you had nine like, was it nine to five job? What were you doing work wise?\n\nYeah. I was working at a bank.\n\nI I was in, like you know, I studied accounting finance. I was, like, in that route doing, like, auditing stuff. It was actually IT audit.\n\nIt's probably one of the most boring jobs you could you could think of, but, it paid well.\n\nThe hours were super chill. And, like, you know, I knew it was gonna give me the time to work on something else on the side.\n\nGotcha. Yeah. So the agency was, like, almost a way to escape the nine to five and sort of, like, build something for yourself, I suppose.\n\nMhmm. Yeah. Like, literally, everything I did up until now was to for was for that objective. It was just that none of them works before. Right? I was doing drop shipping and shit back in, like, twenty Oh, you can't everyone else. Everyone's Everyone everyone's done drop shipping.\n\nDid.\n\nI swear everyone everyone tries drop shipping, and then they run into a Facebook ad account restriction, and then they just go to Esteban May because that's like that's That's exactly what happens.\n\nYeah. Yeah. My personal account's restricted on Facebook. Like, it's it's the exact everyone that does, like, SMA on YouTube, especially they they all the same. Sorry. It's quite funny.\n\nIt's pretty common, man. So so okay. So so fast, so go back a bit in time a bit. So you had one client. You booked a call to to to us to to look at the program. What was it that motivated you to book the call, and and why did you made the decision to buy it?\n\nIt's a good question. Like and I was talking to you about this earlier, but, like, there was there was no, like I remember when I was, like, on the sales call with you guys, and you're like, you know, why do you need to do like, you have to go through the whole process. Like, why do you wanna do this now? Right?\n\nLike, what's the motivation? I was like, I don't know. Like, I just I did because I was still at the I guess there was a strong motivation. Right?\n\nI spent two months, like, without getting into second clients, which is obviously a big pain point for me. Yeah. But the big problem for me the weird thing for me was, like, I had actually joined another program, like, one month before I joined you guys. But I was like, I wanna do things faster.\n\nRight? So then I was like, I just I and I was just looking for the best program out there. I was watching your channel for, like, at least probably, like, a few months at this point, like, probably one or two months. And, you know, you see you're probably I mean, it's very easy to tell when someone is at least for me, it's very, very easy to tell when someone's, like, actually trustworthy on on YouTube.\n\nWow. I tried. I appreciate that.\n\nBut, like, I think I think it's easy to tell, like, when you've been in the space for a while. You're like, okay. This guy is, like, you know, he's not pulling shit out of the ass. Yeah.\n\nI think, like, you you sort of sense.\n\nRight?\n\nEspecially if you've been burned before, you sort of get this.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nYou can just see straight through the bullshit, which is which is a pretty useful skill to have. So so the so, basically, you had you had one client, but it had been, like, two months and you were sort of plateaued and you were sort of, like, struggling to get more swaggy. That makes sense. So what the hell happened in the two months between you joining and getting ten grand a month? Like, what what did you do? What parts of the program did you use? Like, if you could share that, that I'm sure that'd be useful for everyone to know, like, what steps you took.\n\nYeah. I'm like so I mean, one thing I wanna put out there is, like, there is a lot in the program. Right? Especially the newer version of it.\n\nBut, like, even before, it was, like, there there was so much stuff. I don't think I used even more than, like, twenty percent of it. That's pretty common. I think Yeah.\n\nBut, like, I I I think the thing that actually helped me the most obviously, like, the content was really good. I think it literally has everything you need to to really build an agency.\n\nBut I think what really helped the most for me to get those results was just having that the the support. Right? Like, the coaching aspect of the program where you, like like, I think I don't know. I mean, you've probably been through your Fair Share programs, but, like, most most programs that have, like, a Facebook group, or, like, a school group or whatever, especially Facebook groups. Like, they're not active. Right? They're they're very, like they they say that it's like a coaching program where they support you, but they don't, like, it's you see, like, ten, twenty posts a day, and then maybe, like, one question gets answered.\n\nYou guys, like, literally address every single question in detail, and, like, you provide, like you actually provide coaching on every single, like, for every single student that that shows up, which is pretty crazy.\n\nThis is a really good point, and it's it's it's we we've had this feedback a couple of times before, but, usually, everyone's so content focused that it doesn't get brought up. But but, dude, like, with we have, like, this rule at the company. Like, if a support ticket like, we can't if it's been more than twelve hours and it hasn't got an answer, like, I'm flipping my shit. I'm like, like, what is going on? Like, why is this not being answered? But also with Easy Grow, we're introducing, more calls as well to, like, in in improve that amount of stuff that we do. So that's that's actually really good to hear.\n\nHaven't thought about it that way before. But I guess, to be fair, I don't really check the Facebook groups or the program. So but, I'm glad you found it useful. So what's what was the thing that got you ten grand a month then?\n\nBecause, obviously, like, the coaching's great and and having questions answered, but did you use the cold email system? Was it the cold calling thing, cold messaging thing? Did you use the sales script, the mindset stuff? What what exactly did you use?\n\nSo let me think about this. Because I actually didn't pull, like, the specific too much specific concept program. Like, I actually didn't use, like, the Loom system that that much. Although I know it it, like, works because I've I've seen it work for a lot of people.\n\nYeah. But, like, I I just went, like I think it was more of a a mindset thing. And, like, I think the the the focus on, it was I think it was the approach. Because I was doing cold email.\n\nRight? I was just doing plain text cold email.\n\nAnd I think it was, like, these minor things here and there, like how you get people to show up for appointments, like, the the follow-up systems, and just, like, also the service delivery systems. Like, a lot of the, like, just it it's like that peace of mind knowing you can scale because you have the right things in place. Right?\n\nLike, even just, like, timing the right payment processor or payment Just the right just the right the right onboarding It's just the right thing in place.\n\nRight? Yeah. Onboarding, systems, just, like, knowing you can, like like, bring like, when when it's it's that thing. I think you mentioned this probably somewhere.\n\nBut, you know, when when you're at the end of a sales call and the client's like, okay. Like, okay. How do we, like, get started? Like, what does it look like we're gonna work with you?\n\nI'm like, you can I can literally say this, this, this, this, and then, like, they're like, okay? Cool. Let's let's do it. Right?\n\nAnd that's that makes a huge difference. Just knowing you have in your back pocket, like, this process you're gonna bring the client through. And I think that allowed me to just go, like, you know, basically automate my outreach and, like, you know, pump out as much, yeah, pump out as much outreach as possible because I knew that, you know, once I get people on sales calls, like, I'm gonna get someone, like, to be a client. And then Yeah.\n\nI just I just cranked it up. And my conversion rates are pretty good. I I I think the I I think the success for my email actually came from, like, yeah, it probably came from your YouTube videos, actually. It's just the mindset of, like, just being unique and, like, you know, standing out.\n\nI mean, you probably iterated on the iterated on the in the program as well, which is, like, you know, just just don't copy the shit that I'm giving you. Right?\n\nJust don't copy. It's like copying and paste. It's just copy and waste, man.\n\nLike Exactly.\n\nAnd, like, it's something I, like, try to tell people on my YouTube channel too. It's like, dude, like, don't don't, like, I'm not gonna give you scripts. Charlie's not gonna give you scripts because it's not gonna work.\n\nRight? We have it. We have this as like a a rule in in easy grow, the the new program.\n\nAnd, like, you know, we've we've got, like, eleven different systems for acquisition. I'm sure you've probably been through some of them or you're watching some of it as well.\n\nBut you probably heard me say more than once in Easy Grow in the first video, like, don't copy. Don't copy. Like and I just keep repeating that over and over again because, like, it's the biggest mistake people make. Because if you don't understand, like, the thinking or the engineering behind the the system, then if it breaks, you're fucked.\n\nSo everyone just tries, like, they think, oh, if I just had, like, the right piece of email copy or something, they think they'd be fine. But yeah. So I hear you that. So, dude, here's the thing, though.\n\nSo you're at ten grand a month now. You sort of hovering up, you know, maybe a little bit more, maybe a little bit less depending on, like, your service delivery and how many clients you have. But now you're at that sort of six figure run rate on average. Like, let's talk about now.\n\nSo you've gone from doing sort of one thousand dollars a month to struggling to get clients to, you know, sort of ten grand a month, about six figure mark. And, you know, now you've got a routine sort of predictable system of getting people in and you're working on service delivery. How does it feel to actually be at six figures? Because you don't strike me as a massive emotional person when it comes to money.\n\nNow I might be completely wrong there because you you mentioned earlier you didn't have, like, a huge wild motivation. But, like, has it changed your life much, or are you sort of living a similar life? How does it feel?\n\nI mean, the short answer is my life has hasn't really changed at all. Like, I if anything, like, I feel more stressed than before. Okay. But, it's it's like that mindset of, like, when you realize because I guess what I guess once because now that I quit my job too, there's, like, no safety net. Right? So when I look around, I'm talking I'm also networking with a lot of, like, other successful entrepreneurs, like, close to my age, and it's like, you realize how little ten k is. Right?\n\nThat's the problem.\n\nAs soon as as soon as you get a ten k right amount, you think, oh, that's not much, is it?\n\nFuck. But you but, like, you see it as a is this sort of, like, be all end all goal that you put on a pedestal. But as soon as you achieve it, you're like you realize that really it isn't much at all, which is hard to believe for people who haven't got it yet. But just wanna carry on.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. And, like but, like, hundred percent. Right? And I think the I guess the biggest reason is, like, now that I know what I where I want to go with the agency or just with, like, business in general, I know, like, I need to hire, like, you know, really good people. I need I need to, like, you know, pay for a lot of things.\n\nAnd even just, like, living in a nicer place. Right? All that kind of stuff. And it it's all for that purpose of, like, you know, how can it become more effective and, like, build a better business.\n\nAnd you realize this stuff doesn't come cheap. Right? Like, just just to have all these things. So, like, ten k a month is like, okay.\n\nI need because I I think another thing that people kind of don't tell you on, like, YouTube and stuff when it comes to, like, oh, how to get, like, five clients or ten k per month. It's it's very easy to get a ten k per month if you just, like, spam, like, a like, one specific, like, system. Right? Like, if you have an, like, the cold email system that books you, like, two percent meetings, like, it has a two percent booking.\n\nRight? You can spam that and get ten k per month. But then, like, like, after that, it's like, okay. Like, shit.\n\nLike, how do I it's it's very hard to get the twenty k per month if we didn't have the right systems to get to that ten k per month. Yeah. So and and, like, I kinda had I kinda made that mistake. It's like, okay.\n\nLike, I signed all these clients. I just offered, like you know, I I just kinda, like, made the custom offers and then, like, number service deliveries all over the place. So I think, like, I think a lot of people can run into that mistake. It's like and it that's why it's really easy for, like, maybe some other program to, like, promise, like, one or two or three clients, but they don't teach you, like, how to, like, sustainably sustainably build a business.\n\nRight? Mhmm. And so I think for me, I think that's where a lot of the stress is coming from, and I don't feel like I really have a proper business yet until I have that, like, you know, that full back end in place. But I hear you.\n\nYeah.\n\nEmotionally, like It's yeah.\n\nGo on. Sorry.\n\nGo ahead. Yeah.\n\nWhat was I gonna say? You were saying that. Emotionally yeah. Emotionally, it hasn't really changed much.\n\nI think, like, I'm I I don't feel like I've really reached where I wanna be yet because Mhmm. Yeah. It it just it doesn't feel like ten k per month. It's more like, okay.\n\nI have, like, the money, like, coming in and out. But another thing is I'm still paying off. Like, I I pay for so many programs. I'm still, like, paying this off, in these last two months.\n\nSo, like, it doesn't feel like I even have the money yet.\n\nYeah. I hear you. I think it's like people expect ten k a month to be this sort of, like, glorious experience. And I think when you hit it, it is for about a week.\n\nThen you realize, shit. I've made all this mess. I've gotta clean it all up. Because it is you have to sort of, you know, messy with it and sort of, you know, pull your sleeves up and sort of get you create a messy business, essentially.\n\nAnd then you get to take around and you think, oh, shit. Like, it's it's I'm working way too many hours and it's just chaos and stuff like that. So it's actually quite refreshing to hear you say that because most people glorify it when in reality, it is like, I'd rather be stressed out making ten grand a month than work a job that I hate. But at the same time, it's not all people make it out to be.\n\nDoes that make sense? Especially if you haven't got good foundations in place, which is a good thing to know.\n\nSo what's the next thing you want to do? Because you've talked a little bit about the future in terms of hiring people, but what what is the next goal for you, like, six, twelve months from now? Where do you see your agency going?\n\nYeah. So, I mean, I did I remember, like, the beginning of the year, I was like, okay. I wanna hit fifty k a month, right, with my agency by the end of the year. But I was like, I kinda sat there.\n\nI was like, that seems very realistic to me. I wanna aim for, like, a hundred k a month. Right? I don't think I'm gonna hit it necessarily, but I think, like, I wanna, you know, at least set that goal for myself.\n\nAnd because it it's like I think it I think it's also, like, because I surround myself with and just join all these programs, get all this mentorship and stuff. You realize it's very possible to hit these numbers, to, like Yeah. You know? Because getting from zero to ten k a month is a lot harder than getting from ten k to, like, you know, maybe twenty, thirty, fifty k a month just because you know what needs to be done at this point.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo I think, yeah, that's probably just gonna be my goal, like, fifty to a hundred k a month, which, you know, may sound crazy to some people, but, like, it's I think it's very realistic if I just do what I need to do.\n\nBut You you'll find as well once you hit, like, fifty, you have the same mental paradox where it's like, oh, this isn't much. Like, shit. Like, oh, now I've got all this mess again. So it's like it's just like you you level up.\n\nLike, you know, I remember when when I think back to when I started, like, you know, seven or eight years ago now, if if you told me, like, oh, yeah. Hey, Charlie. When you're, like, twenty four, you're gonna be doing, like, you know, twenty grand a day. I'd be like, no.\n\nThere's no there's no chance. But then when you do it, it's like, oh, this doesn't seem like much money. So it's such a strange, like, paradox, but but I hear you, man. So so one question I I I ask everyone on these interviews is if you were thinking about buying this thing, but you're on the fence, what would you say to yourself knowing what you know now and having been through the program?\n\nYeah. Well, I don't think I'm the right person to talk to because, like, I was already sold on investing in myself at the beginning because I I kind of been to this journey before. Right? Like, you know, ecommerce, all that all that kind of shit.\n\nBut Ah, the journey.\n\nThe strategy thing. Backstory.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We've we've been burned by ten k programs. We've, you know, had failed.\n\nLike, we failed in everything possible. So I know what that journey is like. But, yeah, for someone who's, like, maybe new to business, due to SMMA, I'm just, you know, starting for the first time.\n\nI mean, I think you can make this very clear too, which is, like, this isn't for complete complete beginners. Right? Like Yeah. It it can it definitely works for beginners, like but if you're not even in the mindset to, like, build a proper business yet, like, this isn't for you. Right? Well, this is because there's a Yeah.\n\nI I spoke to I spoke to Eric because you're you're totally right because I spoke to Eric Cavlas, who's another person I interviewed, before you about an hour ago. And he went from zero to thirty k a month for five months. And he was saying, like, don't do it if you're not willing to work really bloody hard.\n\nBecause it's like it could be transparent with everyone. Like, you know, if you hop into the program, but you're not willing to, like, give your heart and soul to it, then don't bother. Because, like, you know, it's it's it's something that people seem to think is gonna be like this easy walk in the park, but it it we will know full well that it's not. But then everyone seems to say that it is, and then they try and do it, and their expectations are set completely so if I did interrupt you, I I I don't know if I if you can remember what you said.\n\nYeah. No. I mean, I totally agree with Harry. Like like, all this stuff, like, especially the mindset stuff, like, it's very important.\n\nIt's very true. You need to know this stuff. But the thing is I knew most of that stuff already because it took me, like, two years of, like, killing myself to actually, like, learn it the hard way. Right?\n\nSo but, like, but, like, if you don't do that, then, like, you can do it in, like, you know, two to three months. But, again, you're gonna have to work your ass off just to even, like, put yourself in the right state to start using using using the course. Yeah. But, yeah, if you're like if you're like, you know, you got a couple of clients or you're like, you're you really know you're ready to go hard, on your business, then, yeah, I think, literally, it gives you all the tools you need.\n\nRight? I I think, like, you guys hold nothing back. That's that's a given.\n\nLike, especially especially the client acquisition, like, especially with Easy Grow now. Right?\n\nYeah. We didn't fuck around.\n\nLike, I don't there's there's there's there's literally nothing left you could add to the client acquisition.\n\nI think that I don't Well, you you you wait and see.\n\nWe're gonna try and add more to it. But Yeah. But yeah.\n\nLike, I'm sure there's more, but, like, just, like, if you wanna get to ten k per month, there's, like, five different ways to do it, right, with in your program. Like and and, like, probably when when will we be on ten k per month, of course. But, like, yeah, I think and then, again, like, it's it's it's just one of those complete programs where it's like you know, obviously, you don't focus because you can't really do service delivery that in that detail because, like Yeah.\n\nSo this is one Everyone's service delivery is different.\n\nThis is one thing that we've we've always had is, like, you know, when there's, like, thirty, forty different niches, like, we've got a service delivery module, but it has to be evergreen. So it has to walk through, like, the foundations and everything. So anyone who hops in, like, just for transparency, we don't have, like, here are the ads you use for real estate because we can't do that because we we're not in that niche. But what we can do is we can walk you through the frameworks of what create good ads and then you have to sort of think.\n\nSo it's kind of going back to what we said earlier. Like, it's not a copy and paste thing. You know? Know?\n\nIt's like there's literally a program in this space called copy paste agency, which, you know, in my opinion, is, like, not the right way to do it. But, ultimately yeah. So I I appreciate that. So you wanna get to a hundred grand a month next and you wanna try and do that by the end of the year, which should be well, I'd be open to doing another interview if that was the case.\n\nBut, mate, honestly, I think it's a very inspiring journey. I think that you've done something that a lot of people dream to do. And I also think it's important to know that whilst you did it in two months, you're sat on two years of experience.\n\nBecause this is the important thing that people miss is, like, you've been through hell and back for two years, and you've got your mindset and your work ethic built up to the point that all you needed was the right information. And then when you have that, like, voom, you just sort of flew. So I think that's important to know. But, hey. I I mean, that's an amazing story. Do you have anything else you wanna share? Or you can maybe plug your YouTube channel for a second, and then we can call it a day.\n\nNot too much I wanna share. I mean, it's actually I guess the message I do wanna share is, like, probably what I already talked about on my channel, which is, like, you know, it's, like, it's it's very this business model is very, like, simple. Right? But it's just those, like, it's just those small little details that, like, it it's because I I I get a lot of beginners, right, in my in my own community, like, asking me all these basic questions. Because it's all these small things you have to get together before keeping, like, start working, like, doing the work as an entrepreneur.\n\nBut, like, I think this program will give you, like, eighty to ninety percent of it, but you gotta work your ass on. Right? Oh, yeah. Like, like, no matter no no course or program or coaching is gonna save your ass if you don't, like, just put in as much work as possible. Exactly.\n\nDo you know?\n\nMy sister just my sister just walked into the frame.\n\nAnyway, right, we'll call it that because she probably wants me to go and do something. But, anyways, guys, so Ryan's YouTube link will be in the description.\n\nGo and check it out, subscribe, and everything. And this is the part where I just gently plug what we do. If you do resonate with Ryan's story or you want a way of getting more clients or you just want a great agency, you can click the first thing in the description. It's It's a sales funnel.\n\nIt's designed to sell you something. You can check it out if you want to. I don't really mind if you click it or not, but, you know, might change your life as we did with Ryan, for example. So, mate, it's been an absolute pleasure.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nOh, thank you as well. And, you know, really looking forward to see what you do with, like, easy girl. Very, very exciting stuff. But congratulations on the launch.\n\nAwesome, brother. Talk to you later. Cheers.\n\nYeah. You too. Take care.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/j1pkqs3vzt?autoplay=0&wmode=transparent&wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

How's it going? And welcome to another client interview. I've got a lot more of these ones lined up, so they're gonna be on the way.\n\nBut in this video, I interview Ryan Mack who is also a fellow YouTuber in the SMMA space. You may have heard of him before. His channel will be linked in the description. But Ryan, joined us back.\n\nSo now it's February when I'm recording this. Right? Ryan joined us on October the seventh, and by the middle of December, he was making ten thousand dollars a month. He started doing one thousand dollars a month with one client, and he joined us because he couldn't get any more clients.\n\nHe basically he had the sort of foundations of the business. He'd been through a couple of courses to start, but he just couldn't grow. So he came on board and, you know, basically fast forward two months. He went from one grand a month to ten grand a month.\n\nAnd in this video, he basically explains how he did it, how he used our program, and also the dark side of making that money and, like, you know, why it might not actually be, like, the best thing in the world. Basically, everything is revealed in the video. Ryan's a great guy. He's really quite a little bit, and I'm hoping that you can derive some value from this interview.\n\nNow, obviously, the intention of me making these videos is to help you. But, you know, with this one specifically, it's to actually introduce our program to you and potentially sell it to you. So there will be a link that you can click in the description that goes to a sales funnel that will ask you to book a call. I don't care if you click it or not.\n\nYou don't have to. But, ultimately, if you do want to grow your agency and you're struggling and you want more clients, then you can click it. Alright? And it's a funnel.\n\nIt's designed to sell you something for full transparency. I don't mind if you click it or not. Without further ado, let's hop into the interview. I hope you enjoy it, and I will see you soon.\n\nHave a good day.\n\nAlright, everybody. How's it going? And welcome back to another client interview. I don't get bored of doing these. I love them to bits. And today, I have the man, the myth, the legend, Ryan, with me. Ryan's a client of mine who's been working with me.\n\nSo now is February.\n\nRyan started in now is February. Ryan started in October. And by December, by Christmas time, you were making ten thousand dollars a month in your agency if I'm if I'm not mistaken. So, basically, Ryan went from one k a month to ten k a month or ten thousand six hundred dollars a month to be precise in about sixty days using the program, which is pretty cool. So we're interviewing him to find out what happened. But, Ryan, why don't you just take a second to introduce yourself and just, you know, who you are, what niche you're in, etcetera, etcetera.\n\nYeah. For sure. Yeah. My name is Ryan.\n\nI have been running a YouTube ads agency in the info product space. That's kind of I was kinda dabbling around, like, other services before I started. I think I was in content creation, but where I really started to scale was with YouTube ads, info products. And I, you know, document a little bit on online on my channel and stuff.\n\nBut, yeah, so that's basically what I've been doing. I also do, like, a little bit of funnel building for my clients. I think that's what made, you know, some of the, sale a little bit easier. It's like, when you, like, convince people that you can actually help them, like, get the results as opposed to, you know, just running ads for them.\n\nSo, yeah, that's what I've been doing, pretty much since then.\n\nCool. Amazing. So what what we're gonna do here, just so everyone's aware of the structure, is we'll take a look at sort of, like, where you were, where you are, what the future looks like. But before we go into any of that, that sort of, like, last, you know, two months timeline, what I'd like to know is why you started in the first place. What were you doing before you actually started your agency, before you signed your first client and and came on board with us?\n\nYeah. That that's funny because you can literally you can literally see exactly what I was doing before that because I was doing nothing on YouTube. I was trying to grow, like, like, a personal brand, but with, like, nothing to back it up. Right?\n\nI was talking about, like, some, like, personal development stuff, and, yeah, I had, like, four hundred subs when I for, like, like, over eight months of the work, which was pretty embarrassing. And I realized, like, you know, I was on that whole journey of entrepreneurship and whatever, but I had nothing to show for it because I actually moved out from, like I I left my hometown or my home city and moved, like, to the middle of nowhere. I was like, okay. I'm I was, like, in that I I was gonna do that, like, whole, like, you know, grind here.\n\nRight?\n\nYeah. Yeah. But I, like, I I had I had, like, I was, like, four months in. Had this YouTube channel with four hundred subs and no money coming in besides, like, my date job, obviously. But it was pretty I felt like shit. So I was like, am I on the cuss on these on these agendas? Yeah, mate.\n\nGo for it. Yeah. Yeah. You you go for it.\n\nThat's fine.\n\nYeah. So and then, like, in the middle of that, like, August, I was, okay, dude. I gotta start making money. Right?\n\nOtherwise, like, what am I doing? So then that's when I got, like, my first clients. That that first video, like, actually kinda popped off of my channel. I was like, let's just talk about SMMA, and then, like, it's, like, my biggest video by far now.\n\nBut Cool.\n\nBut the thing is I spent yeah. I I I was doing nothing, literally. I I wanna do something with my life, but, but YouTube wasn't Yeah. Cutting it for me at the time.\n\nYeah. Just just for context, Ryan actually has a YouTube channel where he sort of documented SMMA journey. It will be linked in the description so you guys can go and have a look at that one. So so you had you had nine like, was it nine to five job? What were you doing work wise?\n\nYeah. I was working at a bank.\n\nI I was in, like you know, I studied accounting finance. I was, like, in that route doing, like, auditing stuff. It was actually IT audit.\n\nIt's probably one of the most boring jobs you could you could think of, but, it paid well.\n\nThe hours were super chill. And, like, you know, I knew it was gonna give me the time to work on something else on the side.\n\nGotcha. Yeah. So the agency was, like, almost a way to escape the nine to five and sort of, like, build something for yourself, I suppose.\n\nMhmm. Yeah. Like, literally, everything I did up until now was to for was for that objective. It was just that none of them works before. Right? I was doing drop shipping and shit back in, like, twenty Oh, you can't everyone else. Everyone's Everyone everyone's done drop shipping.\n\nDid.\n\nI swear everyone everyone tries drop shipping, and then they run into a Facebook ad account restriction, and then they just go to Esteban May because that's like that's That's exactly what happens.\n\nYeah. Yeah. My personal account's restricted on Facebook. Like, it's it's the exact everyone that does, like, SMA on YouTube, especially they they all the same. Sorry. It's quite funny.\n\nIt's pretty common, man. So so okay. So so fast, so go back a bit in time a bit. So you had one client. You booked a call to to to us to to look at the program. What was it that motivated you to book the call, and and why did you made the decision to buy it?\n\nIt's a good question. Like and I was talking to you about this earlier, but, like, there was there was no, like I remember when I was, like, on the sales call with you guys, and you're like, you know, why do you need to do like, you have to go through the whole process. Like, why do you wanna do this now? Right?\n\nLike, what's the motivation? I was like, I don't know. Like, I just I did because I was still at the I guess there was a strong motivation. Right?\n\nI spent two months, like, without getting into second clients, which is obviously a big pain point for me. Yeah. But the big problem for me the weird thing for me was, like, I had actually joined another program, like, one month before I joined you guys. But I was like, I wanna do things faster.\n\nRight? So then I was like, I just I and I was just looking for the best program out there. I was watching your channel for, like, at least probably, like, a few months at this point, like, probably one or two months. And, you know, you see you're probably I mean, it's very easy to tell when someone is at least for me, it's very, very easy to tell when someone's, like, actually trustworthy on on YouTube.\n\nWow. I tried. I appreciate that.\n\nBut, like, I think I think it's easy to tell, like, when you've been in the space for a while. You're like, okay. This guy is, like, you know, he's not pulling shit out of the ass. Yeah.\n\nI think, like, you you sort of sense.\n\nRight?\n\nEspecially if you've been burned before, you sort of get this.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nYou can just see straight through the bullshit, which is which is a pretty useful skill to have. So so the so, basically, you had you had one client, but it had been, like, two months and you were sort of plateaued and you were sort of, like, struggling to get more swaggy. That makes sense. So what the hell happened in the two months between you joining and getting ten grand a month? Like, what what did you do? What parts of the program did you use? Like, if you could share that, that I'm sure that'd be useful for everyone to know, like, what steps you took.\n\nYeah. I'm like so I mean, one thing I wanna put out there is, like, there is a lot in the program. Right? Especially the newer version of it.\n\nBut, like, even before, it was, like, there there was so much stuff. I don't think I used even more than, like, twenty percent of it. That's pretty common. I think Yeah.\n\nBut, like, I I I think the thing that actually helped me the most obviously, like, the content was really good. I think it literally has everything you need to to really build an agency.\n\nBut I think what really helped the most for me to get those results was just having that the the support. Right? Like, the coaching aspect of the program where you, like like, I think I don't know. I mean, you've probably been through your Fair Share programs, but, like, most most programs that have, like, a Facebook group, or, like, a school group or whatever, especially Facebook groups. Like, they're not active. Right? They're they're very, like they they say that it's like a coaching program where they support you, but they don't, like, it's you see, like, ten, twenty posts a day, and then maybe, like, one question gets answered.\n\nYou guys, like, literally address every single question in detail, and, like, you provide, like you actually provide coaching on every single, like, for every single student that that shows up, which is pretty crazy.\n\nThis is a really good point, and it's it's it's we we've had this feedback a couple of times before, but, usually, everyone's so content focused that it doesn't get brought up. But but, dude, like, with we have, like, this rule at the company. Like, if a support ticket like, we can't if it's been more than twelve hours and it hasn't got an answer, like, I'm flipping my shit. I'm like, like, what is going on? Like, why is this not being answered? But also with Easy Grow, we're introducing, more calls as well to, like, in in improve that amount of stuff that we do. So that's that's actually really good to hear.\n\nHaven't thought about it that way before. But I guess, to be fair, I don't really check the Facebook groups or the program. So but, I'm glad you found it useful. So what's what was the thing that got you ten grand a month then?\n\nBecause, obviously, like, the coaching's great and and having questions answered, but did you use the cold email system? Was it the cold calling thing, cold messaging thing? Did you use the sales script, the mindset stuff? What what exactly did you use?\n\nSo let me think about this. Because I actually didn't pull, like, the specific too much specific concept program. Like, I actually didn't use, like, the Loom system that that much. Although I know it it, like, works because I've I've seen it work for a lot of people.\n\nYeah. But, like, I I just went, like I think it was more of a a mindset thing. And, like, I think the the the focus on, it was I think it was the approach. Because I was doing cold email.\n\nRight? I was just doing plain text cold email.\n\nAnd I think it was, like, these minor things here and there, like how you get people to show up for appointments, like, the the follow-up systems, and just, like, also the service delivery systems. Like, a lot of the, like, just it it's like that peace of mind knowing you can scale because you have the right things in place. Right?\n\nLike, even just, like, timing the right payment processor or payment Just the right just the right the right onboarding It's just the right thing in place.\n\nRight? Yeah. Onboarding, systems, just, like, knowing you can, like like, bring like, when when it's it's that thing. I think you mentioned this probably somewhere.\n\nBut, you know, when when you're at the end of a sales call and the client's like, okay. Like, okay. How do we, like, get started? Like, what does it look like we're gonna work with you?\n\nI'm like, you can I can literally say this, this, this, this, and then, like, they're like, okay? Cool. Let's let's do it. Right?\n\nAnd that's that makes a huge difference. Just knowing you have in your back pocket, like, this process you're gonna bring the client through. And I think that allowed me to just go, like, you know, basically automate my outreach and, like, you know, pump out as much, yeah, pump out as much outreach as possible because I knew that, you know, once I get people on sales calls, like, I'm gonna get someone, like, to be a client. And then Yeah.\n\nI just I just cranked it up. And my conversion rates are pretty good. I I I think the I I think the success for my email actually came from, like, yeah, it probably came from your YouTube videos, actually. It's just the mindset of, like, just being unique and, like, you know, standing out.\n\nI mean, you probably iterated on the iterated on the in the program as well, which is, like, you know, just just don't copy the shit that I'm giving you. Right?\n\nJust don't copy. It's like copying and paste. It's just copy and waste, man.\n\nLike Exactly.\n\nAnd, like, it's something I, like, try to tell people on my YouTube channel too. It's like, dude, like, don't don't, like, I'm not gonna give you scripts. Charlie's not gonna give you scripts because it's not gonna work.\n\nRight? We have it. We have this as like a a rule in in easy grow, the the new program.\n\nAnd, like, you know, we've we've got, like, eleven different systems for acquisition. I'm sure you've probably been through some of them or you're watching some of it as well.\n\nBut you probably heard me say more than once in Easy Grow in the first video, like, don't copy. Don't copy. Like and I just keep repeating that over and over again because, like, it's the biggest mistake people make. Because if you don't understand, like, the thinking or the engineering behind the the system, then if it breaks, you're fucked.\n\nSo everyone just tries, like, they think, oh, if I just had, like, the right piece of email copy or something, they think they'd be fine. But yeah. So I hear you that. So, dude, here's the thing, though.\n\nSo you're at ten grand a month now. You sort of hovering up, you know, maybe a little bit more, maybe a little bit less depending on, like, your service delivery and how many clients you have. But now you're at that sort of six figure run rate on average. Like, let's talk about now.\n\nSo you've gone from doing sort of one thousand dollars a month to struggling to get clients to, you know, sort of ten grand a month, about six figure mark. And, you know, now you've got a routine sort of predictable system of getting people in and you're working on service delivery. How does it feel to actually be at six figures? Because you don't strike me as a massive emotional person when it comes to money.\n\nNow I might be completely wrong there because you you mentioned earlier you didn't have, like, a huge wild motivation. But, like, has it changed your life much, or are you sort of living a similar life? How does it feel?\n\nI mean, the short answer is my life has hasn't really changed at all. Like, I if anything, like, I feel more stressed than before. Okay. But, it's it's like that mindset of, like, when you realize because I guess what I guess once because now that I quit my job too, there's, like, no safety net. Right? So when I look around, I'm talking I'm also networking with a lot of, like, other successful entrepreneurs, like, close to my age, and it's like, you realize how little ten k is. Right?\n\nThat's the problem.\n\nAs soon as as soon as you get a ten k right amount, you think, oh, that's not much, is it?\n\nFuck. But you but, like, you see it as a is this sort of, like, be all end all goal that you put on a pedestal. But as soon as you achieve it, you're like you realize that really it isn't much at all, which is hard to believe for people who haven't got it yet. But just wanna carry on.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. And, like but, like, hundred percent. Right? And I think the I guess the biggest reason is, like, now that I know what I where I want to go with the agency or just with, like, business in general, I know, like, I need to hire, like, you know, really good people. I need I need to, like, you know, pay for a lot of things.\n\nAnd even just, like, living in a nicer place. Right? All that kind of stuff. And it it's all for that purpose of, like, you know, how can it become more effective and, like, build a better business.\n\nAnd you realize this stuff doesn't come cheap. Right? Like, just just to have all these things. So, like, ten k a month is like, okay.\n\nI need because I I think another thing that people kind of don't tell you on, like, YouTube and stuff when it comes to, like, oh, how to get, like, five clients or ten k per month. It's it's very easy to get a ten k per month if you just, like, spam, like, a like, one specific, like, system. Right? Like, if you have an, like, the cold email system that books you, like, two percent meetings, like, it has a two percent booking.\n\nRight? You can spam that and get ten k per month. But then, like, like, after that, it's like, okay. Like, shit.\n\nLike, how do I it's it's very hard to get the twenty k per month if we didn't have the right systems to get to that ten k per month. Yeah. So and and, like, I kinda had I kinda made that mistake. It's like, okay.\n\nLike, I signed all these clients. I just offered, like you know, I I just kinda, like, made the custom offers and then, like, number service deliveries all over the place. So I think, like, I think a lot of people can run into that mistake. It's like and it that's why it's really easy for, like, maybe some other program to, like, promise, like, one or two or three clients, but they don't teach you, like, how to, like, sustainably sustainably build a business.\n\nRight? Mhmm. And so I think for me, I think that's where a lot of the stress is coming from, and I don't feel like I really have a proper business yet until I have that, like, you know, that full back end in place. But I hear you.\n\nYeah.\n\nEmotionally, like It's yeah.\n\nGo on. Sorry.\n\nGo ahead. Yeah.\n\nWhat was I gonna say? You were saying that. Emotionally yeah. Emotionally, it hasn't really changed much.\n\nI think, like, I'm I I don't feel like I've really reached where I wanna be yet because Mhmm. Yeah. It it just it doesn't feel like ten k per month. It's more like, okay.\n\nI have, like, the money, like, coming in and out. But another thing is I'm still paying off. Like, I I pay for so many programs. I'm still, like, paying this off, in these last two months.\n\nSo, like, it doesn't feel like I even have the money yet.\n\nYeah. I hear you. I think it's like people expect ten k a month to be this sort of, like, glorious experience. And I think when you hit it, it is for about a week.\n\nThen you realize, shit. I've made all this mess. I've gotta clean it all up. Because it is you have to sort of, you know, messy with it and sort of, you know, pull your sleeves up and sort of get you create a messy business, essentially.\n\nAnd then you get to take around and you think, oh, shit. Like, it's it's I'm working way too many hours and it's just chaos and stuff like that. So it's actually quite refreshing to hear you say that because most people glorify it when in reality, it is like, I'd rather be stressed out making ten grand a month than work a job that I hate. But at the same time, it's not all people make it out to be.\n\nDoes that make sense? Especially if you haven't got good foundations in place, which is a good thing to know.\n\nSo what's the next thing you want to do? Because you've talked a little bit about the future in terms of hiring people, but what what is the next goal for you, like, six, twelve months from now? Where do you see your agency going?\n\nYeah. So, I mean, I did I remember, like, the beginning of the year, I was like, okay. I wanna hit fifty k a month, right, with my agency by the end of the year. But I was like, I kinda sat there.\n\nI was like, that seems very realistic to me. I wanna aim for, like, a hundred k a month. Right? I don't think I'm gonna hit it necessarily, but I think, like, I wanna, you know, at least set that goal for myself.\n\nAnd because it it's like I think it I think it's also, like, because I surround myself with and just join all these programs, get all this mentorship and stuff. You realize it's very possible to hit these numbers, to, like Yeah. You know? Because getting from zero to ten k a month is a lot harder than getting from ten k to, like, you know, maybe twenty, thirty, fifty k a month just because you know what needs to be done at this point.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo I think, yeah, that's probably just gonna be my goal, like, fifty to a hundred k a month, which, you know, may sound crazy to some people, but, like, it's I think it's very realistic if I just do what I need to do.\n\nBut You you'll find as well once you hit, like, fifty, you have the same mental paradox where it's like, oh, this isn't much. Like, shit. Like, oh, now I've got all this mess again. So it's like it's just like you you level up.\n\nLike, you know, I remember when when I think back to when I started, like, you know, seven or eight years ago now, if if you told me, like, oh, yeah. Hey, Charlie. When you're, like, twenty four, you're gonna be doing, like, you know, twenty grand a day. I'd be like, no.\n\nThere's no there's no chance. But then when you do it, it's like, oh, this doesn't seem like much money. So it's such a strange, like, paradox, but but I hear you, man. So so one question I I I ask everyone on these interviews is if you were thinking about buying this thing, but you're on the fence, what would you say to yourself knowing what you know now and having been through the program?\n\nYeah. Well, I don't think I'm the right person to talk to because, like, I was already sold on investing in myself at the beginning because I I kind of been to this journey before. Right? Like, you know, ecommerce, all that all that kind of shit.\n\nBut Ah, the journey.\n\nThe strategy thing. Backstory.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We've we've been burned by ten k programs. We've, you know, had failed.\n\nLike, we failed in everything possible. So I know what that journey is like. But, yeah, for someone who's, like, maybe new to business, due to SMMA, I'm just, you know, starting for the first time.\n\nI mean, I think you can make this very clear too, which is, like, this isn't for complete complete beginners. Right? Like Yeah. It it can it definitely works for beginners, like but if you're not even in the mindset to, like, build a proper business yet, like, this isn't for you. Right? Well, this is because there's a Yeah.\n\nI I spoke to I spoke to Eric because you're you're totally right because I spoke to Eric Cavlas, who's another person I interviewed, before you about an hour ago. And he went from zero to thirty k a month for five months. And he was saying, like, don't do it if you're not willing to work really bloody hard.\n\nBecause it's like it could be transparent with everyone. Like, you know, if you hop into the program, but you're not willing to, like, give your heart and soul to it, then don't bother. Because, like, you know, it's it's it's something that people seem to think is gonna be like this easy walk in the park, but it it we will know full well that it's not. But then everyone seems to say that it is, and then they try and do it, and their expectations are set completely so if I did interrupt you, I I I don't know if I if you can remember what you said.\n\nYeah. No. I mean, I totally agree with Harry. Like like, all this stuff, like, especially the mindset stuff, like, it's very important.\n\nIt's very true. You need to know this stuff. But the thing is I knew most of that stuff already because it took me, like, two years of, like, killing myself to actually, like, learn it the hard way. Right?\n\nSo but, like, but, like, if you don't do that, then, like, you can do it in, like, you know, two to three months. But, again, you're gonna have to work your ass off just to even, like, put yourself in the right state to start using using using the course. Yeah. But, yeah, if you're like if you're like, you know, you got a couple of clients or you're like, you're you really know you're ready to go hard, on your business, then, yeah, I think, literally, it gives you all the tools you need.\n\nRight? I I think, like, you guys hold nothing back. That's that's a given.\n\nLike, especially especially the client acquisition, like, especially with Easy Grow now. Right?\n\nYeah. We didn't fuck around.\n\nLike, I don't there's there's there's there's literally nothing left you could add to the client acquisition.\n\nI think that I don't Well, you you you wait and see.\n\nWe're gonna try and add more to it. But Yeah. But yeah.\n\nLike, I'm sure there's more, but, like, just, like, if you wanna get to ten k per month, there's, like, five different ways to do it, right, with in your program. Like and and, like, probably when when will we be on ten k per month, of course. But, like, yeah, I think and then, again, like, it's it's it's just one of those complete programs where it's like you know, obviously, you don't focus because you can't really do service delivery that in that detail because, like Yeah.\n\nSo this is one Everyone's service delivery is different.\n\nThis is one thing that we've we've always had is, like, you know, when there's, like, thirty, forty different niches, like, we've got a service delivery module, but it has to be evergreen. So it has to walk through, like, the foundations and everything. So anyone who hops in, like, just for transparency, we don't have, like, here are the ads you use for real estate because we can't do that because we we're not in that niche. But what we can do is we can walk you through the frameworks of what create good ads and then you have to sort of think.\n\nSo it's kind of going back to what we said earlier. Like, it's not a copy and paste thing. You know? Know?\n\nIt's like there's literally a program in this space called copy paste agency, which, you know, in my opinion, is, like, not the right way to do it. But, ultimately yeah. So I I appreciate that. So you wanna get to a hundred grand a month next and you wanna try and do that by the end of the year, which should be well, I'd be open to doing another interview if that was the case.\n\nBut, mate, honestly, I think it's a very inspiring journey. I think that you've done something that a lot of people dream to do. And I also think it's important to know that whilst you did it in two months, you're sat on two years of experience.\n\nBecause this is the important thing that people miss is, like, you've been through hell and back for two years, and you've got your mindset and your work ethic built up to the point that all you needed was the right information. And then when you have that, like, voom, you just sort of flew. So I think that's important to know. But, hey. I I mean, that's an amazing story. Do you have anything else you wanna share? Or you can maybe plug your YouTube channel for a second, and then we can call it a day.\n\nNot too much I wanna share. I mean, it's actually I guess the message I do wanna share is, like, probably what I already talked about on my channel, which is, like, you know, it's, like, it's it's very this business model is very, like, simple. Right? But it's just those, like, it's just those small little details that, like, it it's because I I I get a lot of beginners, right, in my in my own community, like, asking me all these basic questions. Because it's all these small things you have to get together before keeping, like, start working, like, doing the work as an entrepreneur.\n\nBut, like, I think this program will give you, like, eighty to ninety percent of it, but you gotta work your ass on. Right? Oh, yeah. Like, like, no matter no no course or program or coaching is gonna save your ass if you don't, like, just put in as much work as possible. Exactly.\n\nDo you know?\n\nMy sister just my sister just walked into the frame.\n\nAnyway, right, we'll call it that because she probably wants me to go and do something. But, anyways, guys, so Ryan's YouTube link will be in the description.\n\nGo and check it out, subscribe, and everything. And this is the part where I just gently plug what we do. If you do resonate with Ryan's story or you want a way of getting more clients or you just want a great agency, you can click the first thing in the description. It's It's a sales funnel.\n\nIt's designed to sell you something. You can check it out if you want to. I don't really mind if you click it or not, but, you know, might change your life as we did with Ryan, for example. So, mate, it's been an absolute pleasure.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nOh, thank you as well. And, you know, really looking forward to see what you do with, like, easy girl. Very, very exciting stuff. But congratulations on the launch.\n\nAwesome, brother. Talk to you later. Cheers.\n\nYeah. You too. Take care."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}}, {});
