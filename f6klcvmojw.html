Hi, everyone. It's Charlie Morgan, and welcome to another video. So today, I'm joined by a client of ours, Jamie, who started working with us. How long has it been, Jamie? Like, six months or something like that?\n\nYeah. Five, six months, I would say.\n\nFive or six wonderful months, basically.\n\nAnd when Jamie joined us, he was running an agency sort of full service. Then we're gonna sort of discuss what problems he had prior to working with us, mostly with acquisition and having focus and everything.\n\nAnd the the sort of moral of the story and the premise of today's video, is how Jamie's basically signed, like, I think it's, like, fifteen clients in the last month or something like that, which is pretty awesome.\n\nAnd we've been working with them, and we've we've basically helped Jamie systemize everything from client acquisition to onboarding to service delivery where he now has a really awesome business that basically just scales and is fully automated. So before we talk about, all of that, Jamie, why don't you just take a second to introduce yourself and tell the people about who you are and what you do and who you work with?\n\nYeah, man. So I'll I'll give you the somewhat long story so in case it might resonate with somebody. My name is Jamie Castle. I own Red Pig Media.\n\nWe're an agency, based in Ireland, and I suppose to give you the the background, I had I've worked in marketing for years. I've always worked in marketing.\n\nBefore starting this agency, I was I was a marketing manager for a large multinational here in Ireland. I had a couple of units around Ireland.\n\nDid it for a couple of years, ended up falling out of love with it, falling out of love with the corporate structure and the policies and having your creativity kinda hemmed in, being told what to do, you know, having to ask to go on holidays, all this kind of stuff. I hated it.\n\nSo pulled the trigger and handed my notice in January twenty twenty. Mhmm. Bought a one way ticket to Colombia for February twenty twenty. And when February twenty twenty came around, all flights were grounded.\n\nNobody was going anywhere. So it was the first time since I was thirteen years old that I didn't have a job. I always had a job, you know, after school, hard time, weekends, whatever. So this is the very, very first time, but it just seemed like the best opportunity to actually go for something and start something.\n\nI don't know why it it felt like a good decision, but it did.\n\nSo, yeah, I went for it. Kinda started to think about an agency. It meant it meant sense, seen as all I have ever done was marketing. So Mhmm. Created an agency, kind of launched it around August twenty twenty, but didn't make a red cent until December, twenty twenty. So, we're pretty much a year into actually, like, making money.\n\nAnd, yeah, ups and downs for sure.\n\nYou know, some good months at the start, some some shit months at the start.\n\nI don't know how you're gonna title this video, but there is a month March twenty twenty where I met five hundred quid. Yeah. And that that probably spans six weeks. That was probably more than than just the month that was the taking.\n\nSo I think it was March twenty twenty. So, ups and downs, some good months and bad months, but the the issue was we were offering everything. Yeah. It's it's not something that I'd ever even recommend to one of my clients.\n\nI think it's multiple porters. You can't be all thing to all people. That's exactly what I was trying to do.\n\nI think because most even entrepreneurs, freelancers that start out, it's the first time your your income is you're totally responsible for your income. Mhmm. So you're gonna take whatever comes your way. Mhmm.\n\nYou're gonna take jobs that you don't know how to do and figure out how to do them after you get them. So that's what we were doing. We're we're, you know, six or seven different types of services. There are six or seven different types of people involved and kind of contracted to me and working for me.\n\nYeah. So there was months where revenue was great, but profitably shit. Mhmm. And there was no systems in place at all at all.\n\nSo I had been talking to, like, other course providers or, like, people that help you kinda scale your system, this kind of stuff. Yeah. None none of them ever connected with me. You reached out.\n\nWe hopped on, and, yeah, everything you said kind of kind of made sense. It was what I was looking for. It was systems. Yep. It was kind of figuring out yeah. It was systems. It was kinda scaling back and learning how to be good at one thing.\n\nAnd I remember I don't know if you remember our sales call or not, but I remember calling you a bastard for selling to me so well. No.\n\nI think I do remember that, mate.\n\nYeah. Like, we we got you on board on that first call, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nYeah. And, and, yeah, I remember you saying something along those lines. You're like, gosh. You're too good at this. You bastard or something.\n\nYeah. It it like, it's the case. Like, I I read this all the time in business books or mindset books or whatever kind of self help books. You need to find somebody that's doing what you want to do and learn from them, which is exactly what you and Bo have done. You've scaled your agency already to whatever it is, multi multi seven figures.\n\nNow you're doing this, and I wanted to learn how to sell like you as well. I get I get that from quite a lot of people because, obviously, like, because we haven't had any prior case studies, personal brand, or ads to leverage for Empyreum, We've had to rely on cold email and our own sales skills.\n\nAnd, like, one of the main things we say from people is like they're like, how do I know your system works?\n\nI'm like, well, how did you hear about us and get on this call and get this close to giving us, like, all your money? And they're like, well, you'd sent me a cold email, and you've done a very, very good sales process.\n\nAnd I was like, well, if we can convince you to go through this process with us, how easy do you think it is for us to teach you how to do the same thing for other people who are far less skeptical than you are? So, yeah, I I get that, and I'm really glad you came on board because well, you know, the way the way I sell and the way we're teaching our reps to sell is it's like if you've got a product that can change someone's life, which I know this product does as evidenced by by us being here today, it's like you do everything you can to get them on board. Because it's like you've got a winning lottery ticket and you're and you're like, dude, I know if you buy this thing, then you'll get exactly what you want and more.\n\nAnd so, yeah, it's kind of a moral obligation for us to, like, to to sign people. So you you joined us, and you were offering loads of different services, and you had some good months revenue, but shit profit, and you had a month where you made five hundred dollars.\n\nAnd I remember so you you joined us about six months ago, but you've really only been using our outreach methods for about, what, three or four months because you had to sort of figure everything out first. Yeah. And so in in the last, well, since let's say since the start of November, so we're now about, you know, through November and into the middle of December here. So how many clients have you signed in the last couple of months?\n\nFive days if you'd like.\n\nYeah. So I suppose even on your point there, Mhmm.\n\nProbably one of the biggest turnarounds for me, one of the biggest kind of, moments for me in the actual course or making my way through the course was picking a niche.\n\nYeah.\n\nAgain, going back to what I said, we we had loads loads of clients and loads of different niches, loads of different industries, doing loads of different things for them.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo we actually weren't even really getting very good at anything or really getting any really good results for people.\n\nAnd it was just that kinda you you're kind of in limbo.\n\nSo it was kinda scary to think I need to pick a niche because you're kinda thinking, right, well, I'm gonna be hemmed in by this niche now and, you don't have to say no to other people and this kind of thing. But I think on one of the coaching calls, you said something that stuck me and I could butcher it now. But I think you kinda said the reason you pick a niche is so you can be broad.\n\nYou know, so I was kinda thinking, right, so I went in fit. Right?\n\nFinding abundance in scarcity.\n\nYeah. Something along those lines. It's like if you want to have you can't have everything, but you can have anything.\n\nYeah. Correct. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I picked fitness, right, because I had one or two clients in fitness.\n\nI like it myself as an industry. Yeah. I get on well with our clients because they're similar to me, I suppose, in in in a couple of different ways. Yeah.\n\nWhat happened when I actually that day when I picked it, it was like the weight was kind of lifted because I was like, okay. Now I know who I'm going for. Yep. Now I know how to serve them.\n\nNow I know how to speak to them. I can learn how to sell to them. I can learn how to you know, it's it just makes everything a whole lot easier.\n\nAnd when you do think about being broad in a niche, let's say fitness, I can now go after gyms, coaches, CrossFit, boot camps, running swimming trainers, whatever.\n\nAnd it's just it's just it's kind of a weight off when you actually make the when you actually make the decision.\n\nSo what was what was your initial question?\n\nI was just basically asking about how many clients you've signed, but I think you sort of went from, Yeah. From that question to sort of being more streamlined.\n\nBut, like, when you think about back in November to now Yeah.\n\nSo I had maybe one or two. And at the moment, it's looking like we're taking on an awful lot at the moment getting them onboarded for January because, obviously, January's gonna be crazy season. But it's looking like it'll be fifteen, probably sixteen active in January, I think, which is nuts. And the majority of them have come.\n\nLet's just sort of take a second because so you you had your previous agency where you were doing everything for everyone. It wasn't a business. You you were a glorified freelancer, basically. Everything was running through its chaos. You basically shut that down and started a new agency. And so you had basically, like, one client, as you mentioned, maybe two. And you've gone from one to two clients to sixteen paying clients with onboarding fees and pay per lead retainers over the course of what, like, four months, do you reckon?\n\nYeah. Probably about four months. That's fine. What's funny on that is the the very first month I did outreach, obviously, I was doing it all myself fine. I think I booked eighteen calls in the first month. Mhmm. And I think I sold one of them because my offer wasn't right.\n\nYeah. You know?\n\nAnd the outreach is working. I was getting calls. The calls were going really, really well.\n\nThis average from the program or Yeah.\n\nAverage from the program.\n\nThe first month. Yeah. The first month, everything was going well, and they were just on the edge of converting and selling, but I lost them all. Do you know what I mean?\n\nAnd it was just a case of the offer wasn't right. So I tweeted the second month, probably booked a similar amount of calls, and I think I got five out of that month or something like that. And it's funny because the offer we tweaked makes us more money, but it sounds Yeah. Yeah.\n\nIt's more it's more, incentivizing to the actual client to come on that way.\n\nWhy don't you quickly explain how you got went through that process of of creating the offer? Because in the program, we've obviously got that section that teaches you how to create your own sales argument and your own irresistible offer.\n\nDo you wanna quickly touch on on how that helps you through that process?\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know, there's so much in that module that kind of there's almost a checklist of all the stuff you need to have and offer.\n\nYou know, a guarantee, especially incentive based pricing.\n\nA lot of mine came from actual testing.\n\nThe the very first time I tested my sales script was I think you I don't know if you remember, and I I tested with a friend of mine who is in fitness. And I said, I wanted to test his screen.\n\nSo well he called you back up to buy afters. Yeah. Go on. Go on. Tell tell him.\n\nIt's yeah. I I rang him up and said, listen. I'm going into fitness. I have this thing built.\n\nIt's pretty much ready to go, and I just wanna test the script with you. Do you know what I mean? I'm not gonna I'm not trying to sell you anything. I just wanna see what you think of the script.\n\nYeah. And it works so well.\n\nHe had his camera on. I had my camera off. And when you go into the area of creating a little bit of pain for them so they can understand where they need to get to from where they are now, and you place yourself as a vehicle for them to get there. I could see their script working in his face, and I could see the way he was thinking. I could see everything working. Yeah. I was thinking, shit.\n\nThis is That's the the script you used from the program and edited a little.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt's the script I still use now. So, yeah, he called me back and said, you know what? I actually wanna actually wanna come on with you. We said we'd leave it for a couple of months until, you know, everything's good.\n\nThis improved concept first. Yeah. Descriptive is absolutely and it is absolutely insane. You know?\n\nSo the offer probably came from a lot of book was that month of trials and fails. And for one, okay. That actually doesn't work. Mhmm.\n\nBeautiful thing about failing is you've kind of known out what doesn't work. You can test something else.\n\nAnd it looks like we've kinda found, you know, a winning strategy that I'm sure I'm gonna keep tweaking and have already started tweaking to make it even better for us and for them.\n\nBut I suppose that's how that that offer kind of got created. It was obviously through your course, gives you the blueprint. Mhmm. And then you I suppose you kinda bring it to market and and test it yourself. And that's another beautiful thing about the course is you teach us how to create it for ourselves.\n\nSo it's not Yeah.\n\nThere's no sort of copy and paste element of it because that that never works, like, in the long term. So that makes sense. So when in terms of the appointment flow you've currently got because I think because in in the program, we've got, like, six or seven methods for you to book appointments, but you're only using one of them. How many appointments are you booking right now per per week per month? Is it, like like, ten ten per week or some five per week or something similar, like one or two a day or something?\n\nYeah. So it it kinda started off like I said, that first month was was eighteen or so. But I was doing all of the outreach myself. Everything was everything again was through me, and I kinda wanted to take it to kind of the ten k per month mark before I started getting VAs and before just so I knew that it worked. I wanted to learn it as well as I possibly could before I would teach somebody else.\n\nSo at the moment, you know, we're booking over ten over ten calls a week, I would say. Yeah. Pretty easily. Yeah.\n\nSo And that's all automated as well.\n\nIt's all automated. And to be honest with you, Charlie, that was one of the first times I felt like an actual business owner. Right? Because, yeah, glorified freelancer for sure. Everything going through me, kind of making up as you go along. Yeah.\n\nBut when you can have people in place and they're doing their job for you and I can go to bed at night and wake up and there's gonna be ten more emails of people saying that they're interested in my offer, and then you start to feel like, okay. Shit.\n\nI am actually this is That's when like, that's that's one of the one of the best feelings because we did this with Northwell with our agency, like, three and a half years, four years ago when we really started to get the appointment booking thing right.\n\nAnd I remember that I can't remember, but it was like a weekend. And I went to bed this Friday night, and it's the first time that someone else had booked a call for me that was inside of the agency, so not like an external done for you appointment booker.\n\nAnd we built this system, and I I woke up on Saturday, and and I looked at my calendar. Well, I got an email from Calendly, and I booked two calls just over the over the night. And that's when I was like, fuck. That's, like, that's a good feeling. So I resonate with that, man. Just be waiting till you get a sales rep, then you start closing sales without even having to blink. It's like Yeah.\n\nLike, I mean, it's it's a crazy place to be in now so fast, but I know now from what I've learned in the course, the stuff that's already in place, outreach and client acquisition is probably never going to be an issue for me again. I I think it's going to be easy for me to get clients. If I ever needed to shut it off and turn it on again, I think it's gonna be pretty much as easy as that.\n\nBecause this is what Kethu said as well, who the last person who I interviewed just so everybody has the context of that on on the channel.\n\nAnd you you you're talking to us about the same issue he's facing where it's like, I've now got I now know now that I've solved acquisition, the problem I have is operation based, and sort of systemizing that. And so we we've helped you with the process of finding media buyers and system Imperium and they just think appointment booking, but the systems work so fucking well that the problem is no longer appointment booking once you've used them. So do you wanna sort of touch base on what your next steps are? What you think you need to systemize beyond beyond what you're currently doing?\n\nYeah. So, yeah, it's crazy because that outreach thing, it does seem sorted. My sales skills, I think, are up to a point now where I feel very comfortable selling to somebody.\n\nI feel also very comfortable telling somebody that they're not a right fit for us, which is Well, those those two things are basically the same.\n\nAs soon as you get comfortable enough to say to someone, I don't wanna work with you or you're not a good fit, that's when you know, like, you're on you're on on the right track. But yeah. Go on.\n\nYeah. So the next thing, yeah, is service delivery. Right? And and trying to put a system in there where not so much that is automated, but so that it you know that it's good.\n\nYou know that you're shit out on it. The next steps for my agency like, I wouldn't say that it's a certain figure per month. The next steps for me and and our agency is to get is to be one of the best at what we're doing and to to figure out a service delivery that's shit hot, and it gets all of our clients really, really good results. That's That's what the next steps is first.\n\nThat's what I'm gonna be focusing on now and in next year. And obviously, money comes with that and clients come with that anyway. But it's nice to be in a position where you can actually focus on that. So, yeah, through the course, outreach is done.\n\nSales is pretty much dialed in. Mhmm. And onboarding at the moment is is pretty much getting systemized and getting it down very, very fast at least.\n\nI have media buyers on board now, So it's a case of I can I can't take my eyes off it or anything like that, but Mhmm? It's all starting to come into place. And you probably said it as well either in one of the modules or in one of the coaching calls. Mhmm. And it's took me, and it's kinda one of my plans is that I can have a business that is automated in the beginning.\n\nI do a sales call. The service delivery is automated, and all I'm doing is jumping on sales calls and scaling my business constantly.\n\nSo that's the point where I'm trying to get I think the first half of it is done.\n\nThe second half of it now is is definitely the next part, which Yeah.\n\nBecause I think that's that's the sort of thing I wanna do to focus on when you joined us.\n\nBecause, obviously, we we planned like, you kind of it's like you've got the same you're trading under the same business you were prior to working with us, but you've got a totally different agency. And so we shot we shut one down to start a new one. And, ironically, you've scaled this new one in more in three months than the previous one you had over, like, three years or something crazy like that.\n\nAnd it really is just niche selection and building service delivery and onboarding. So you are like the chain, the link between these two facets of the service delivery and onboarding.\n\nSo you are like the chain, the link between these two facets of the business. And then eventually, it's hiring a sales rep. Because because once you've got acquisition, sales, and service delivery and support systemize, you don't really have to do anything. And that's that's what we've been able to do with Northwell to a degree.\n\nLike, you just have key members of your team, and then you just talk to them every week, and they just do their jobs.\n\nBut it's impossible to get to that point because people want automation without proof of concept. And so I see this all the time where people like, oh, I want I wanna scale my agency and use automated systems, and I'm gonna hire a media buyer and a sales rep, and and I'm gonna do all this automated stuff. And it's like, well, you've kind of gotta figure it out yourself before you can pass it on to someone else, and you're in the process of doing that. So that's awesome. Yeah.\n\nIt's not it's not, what's that saying?\n\nIt's not a golden bullet or whatever they say it is.\n\nYeah. Silver bullet or something like that.\n\nLike that.\n\nIt's a shit like golden pill and silver bullet, so you were close.\n\nOkay.\n\nI think it was a pale, golden bullet.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Like, you guys would teach you the strategies, but it's not it's not gonna happen without the hard work. Do you know what I mean? Instead of putting crazy long days, but probably the most important thing out of this whole course coming on with you guys is not so much all the stuff that you learned because it's all a sum of the parts.\n\nFor me, the most important thing that I was able to take away from it was, I suppose, the realization that I can fucking do this. Do you know what I mean? And this can actually be a business and an agency that I can grow to a certain point where it's life changing. Do you know what I mean?\n\nMhmm. I always knew that there was something there. I didn't know what it was. I didn't know how to get there.\n\nI knew that if I could find it, I have the the, like, the self belief in the the work ethic to actually go after it and get it. Mhmm. But it's realizing that I can actually fucking do it.\n\nI think this is Right.\n\nThe first step to to making, like, real progress is recognizing possibility.\n\nBecause it's like it's not in because when it's like with all the stuff we teach in the program and the methods we teach, and people are like, no way you can book appointments with that or no way you can close with that script or I don't think it's possible to to go because, like, you know, you've gone from zero to multi six figures in literally three months, three or four months, right, since you started the new agency if you projected your revenue every year. And to most business people, like, if you said, yeah, hey. You can start a business that goes from zero to, like, two hundred k a year in three months with margins of, like, sixty to eighty percent, they'd be like, no fucking way. There's no way you can do that. But why the hell not? All you could all kind of all you have to do is be crazy enough to believe that something that that's possible and then, you know, learn from people that have done it.\n\nLearn from people that have done it. Yeah. A hundred percent. I think I I don't know if I've said this to you before.\n\nI think I've said it to other people, and don't get offended when I say it. But this course is like how to build a successful agency for dummies because everything is there. Like, literally everything's there. You can't fail if you if you put all the stuff in, if you follow it, if you work hard, you can't fail.\n\nEspecially with, like, the support of you guys, the support of everyone that's in the actual group. The coaching calls, everything is there.\n\nIt shows you how to To let you in on the secret so we've we're in the process of now we've we've got a hundred and fifty people in the group.\n\nWe've probably signed anywhere between, like, hundred and twenty to a hundred and thirty agencies because, obviously, there's a few extra people as a business partners and team members. But out of the hundred and whatever it is we've signed so far, we haven't had a single dispute or we haven't had to process a single full refund or anything like that. Because, obviously, everyone comes on board with the full money back guarantee.\n\nBut we're like, look.\n\nIf you don't make your money back, we'll give you a full refund. But you gotta do the work, and we haven't had one person come to us and ask for a full refund, which is amazing. They're not one dispute, which is kind of weird. And we'll we'll we'll get one. You know, we'll have one every now and then, but it's like the the the weird thing about about us, Jamie, and the the program is that we know it's the best, but we're also terrified that it's not good enough. So we've already got, we've already got plans for next year where we're gonna really, like, it's gonna be, like, three times better than it currently is, which is which is kind of awesome.\n\nAnd we're gonna be spending a lot of time working on it because, you know, right now, like you said, everything's in there, but we want more. Like, I want everyone to be able to hop in and, you know, just add, like, twenty k to their revenue in, like, three months, similar to you've done almost.\n\nBut, like, I've often, I've often told a bunch of money back guarantee.\n\nRight? And I I can't remember what the actual stipulations are if if it's not in a certain time frame or something like that. But once you actually get in to the course and once you actually start doing it, you're like you're like, I'm asking for a refund then. Yeah.\n\nYou'd be like, look. I might not make my money back if I don't put it in right now. It doesn't really matter. The shit that I'm learning here is worth ten times what I paid for the course.\n\nSo I I can't see how anyone would actually come back and say, I want my money back.\n\nYeah. I think, like, you know, it's once people hop in because so many people have been burned by programs before, And I don't know if you've taken courses before this, but I know you were talking to a few people about agency scaling, even just saying it makes my skin crawl because it has such a negative connotation.\n\nBut, like, you know, what we recognized is that I've I mean, with Northwell, we probably invested, like, twenty, thirty, forty grand in courses. Right? And then all the odd one's helpful, but none of them are really super needle moving courses except from anything by Sam Evans. That man's a fucking genius.\n\nAnd so we looked at the the market, and we thought, well, what if we just do what needs to be done? And we actually put together, like, an entire like, it's gonna suck when it's it sucked to record all those videos and stuff. But we have people who hop in and, like, within the first, like, week, we get messages from them saying, thank you for closing me, which is like like, thank you for taking my money. And that's not like a cocky thing from from our perspective, though I'm quite proud of that.\n\nBut, you know, I just we we sort of thought we looked at the industry, and we were like, god. We need to clean this up because there's so much bullshit out there.\n\nAnd, I'm not gonna ask I mean, do you mind me asking already? You don't so much money, spend so much money on courses, it's not in the other. What what what was it for you guys that actually moved the needle? Is it just mentorship with the people that, you know, have done what you're trying to get to?\n\nWhere is it where that you guys kind of Well, the the the the the one person that has moved the needle for us is is Sam Evans.\n\nThat's from an info product perspective and also an agency perspective. Sam Evans is he's an absolute genius. We're we're gonna do his, Quantum Mastermind either this coming year or next year, which is about, like, forty grand or something, and we're gonna go to that.\n\nBut up level consulting is really helpful. Consulting accelerator. But the main thing that's moved the needle for Bo and I collectively through not only getting Northwell to seven figures, but now Imperium to seven figures in pretty much, like, twelve months is mindset.\n\nAnd it's just it's just the belief systems that we've had and developed, and the identities that we've sort of grown into. Because, like, that that's really the thing that moved the needle for us. The strategies and the processes and the the techniques that you need to learn, they all they're all out there for you to just realize, but the first thing is to sort of think, right, I'm the kind of person that can make this really easy.\n\nAnd so, like, we're we're sort of having to grow Imperium now. We wanna go from, you know, high six figures to seven figures, then multi seven figures and eight figures, and that process is purely mindset.\n\nAnd so that's the main thing. And we're gonna be doing a mindset module for the program because we've realized, like, fuck, it's the most important thing, but it's taken us a year to put it together.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And there's a lot of there's a lot of gold dust in terms of mindset in your sales module in there as well. Yeah.\n\nLike I said, that the most important thing was maybe me realizing that I could bring this to a certain level. Probably the second most important thing that I've learned from the course was your sales, module because it's so applicable to life. Mhmm. If you understand how to sell something or if you understand how to handle objections, you probably understand the human psyche a little bit more.\n\nOh, god. Yeah.\n\nAnd it's it's It feeds into everything, aren't it?\n\nKnowing how, like because, really, when you think about, like, an agency or most most companies, really, it's just knowing how to deal with people and getting them to do what you want or getting them to do with what you know is within their best interests, but allows them to grow and allows you to make money.\n\nAnd that's why, like, I think the the thing that springboarded me specifically towards the growth that we've had was my apprenticeship doing cold calls. And I had to make, like, you know, hundred and fifty cold calls a day for, like, eighteen months straight or, like, a year straight.\n\nAnd that was just like because because when because what I realized when we were doing cold calls in the office, and there was two types of people in in the office. One was the person who just did the calls with no enthusiasm, and they basically just, like, hated it. But the other person was the person who hated it, but also actually tried. And it was just by sort of just trying every call, just having that little inflection in your voice or just making the extra call here and there that made it fun because then you get more results.\n\nIronically, everybody whose side got fired anyway, but, yeah, the cold calling man was the was the thing. But, anyway, back to you. So what what what's your plan now? Because I think January, you're probably gonna have, like, a twenty five k month, to be honest with you, because, you know, you're working on performance with pay per lead stuff. Because, you know, that's the cool model as well. But what's your plan?\n\nIt's, it's hard to look at that and and see that as a potential income for a month.\n\nWell, I believe it's for you already.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nI I know that believe so far for you has been right.\n\nYeah. Yeah. No.\n\nWe'll report back, you know, in in a month's time, and and we'll see how we do. But we have onboarded so many people now that if we can deliver, we will one hundred percent be at that point. Mhmm. Like I said, it's at the moment, thankfully, I'm in a in a place where I'm I'm not too worried about finances or sales coming in because I know I can get it.\n\nRight? I know I can get pretty much clients on autopilot now, which is insane. Yeah. It's more so trying to focus on being the best at it, trying to be trying to focus on being the best at the service delivery and getting all of our clients really, really, really good results.\n\nThat's what I'm most worried about at the moment because I know the first half of the equation is done.\n\nIn terms of finance, I I did say to you that one of my goals was to do a thirty six and a half thousand month. Mhmm. That was my previous salary in a job that I felt under undervalued in anyway. Yeah. It would be amazing to kinda do that in in a month. It would be absolutely insane to do it in a month.\n\nIt's trending that way, and I know that, with consistency, it will it will end up going that way Mhmm. With you like, you guys are stuck with me now as well. Any problems I'm gonna have?\n\nWell, it's it's kind of like we we quite enjoy it, man. Mhmm. Because it's we we get to watch you go through the process that we've had to go through for for two businesses.\n\nAnd it you know, it's a nice sort of, there's an element of empathy to it, I suppose, where you can be like, what what do I do? And we're like, well, this is exactly what you do because we remember that quite clearly.\n\nAnd, you know, we do that for all of our clients, obviously, and, you know, you've got the the weekly coaching calls. And the interesting thing and I was I was looking at, because I got interviews with, Ishmael coming up and another guy called Martin, you know, people who have also added, you know, like, multi six figures over the course of, like, a few months of working with us. And, like, I've looked at the underlying sort of thing trying to figure out, like, what do all these people have in common?\n\nAnd it's the coaching calls.\n\nLike, you've been on those ones religiously. Not all of them every week, twice a week, but more often than not, you're on those calls.\n\nWe can't get rid of you.\n\nI mean, don't get me wrong. I love it.\n\nBut, like, I think that the fact that you've just stuck to those and worked hard as a testament because we can give you the content, but if you don't do the work, so you should be proud, man, because you've done They're they're I said in one of my recent posts in the thing, they're they're just full of, like, they're just full of golden nuggets.\n\nThey're just they're insane because something that somebody has struggling with. Either you have struggled with it, you are struggling with it, or you will. Mhmm. And there's so much that you can pick up from what what else, what other people are actually saying on those calls.\n\nThe advice you guys are given like, I I could be working away on one screen. I have the quote and call another screen. Just listen. Some of them just write it down.\n\nYeah. Just put it around.\n\nWe don't like scaling an agency is is really just solving a collection of problems.\n\nAnd, like, problems manifest themselves as questions which people ask us, and then we provide answers which are solutions. And if you have all the solutions, then you know what to do, more actions to take to put cause to effect to get to seven figures. That's all there is to it, and people overcomplicate it. And they think this getting to seven figures or multi six figures or their goal is this, you know, weird abstract thing, and it's all gray, and they can't see what they're doing, what they need to do.\n\nBut, really, you just recognize it's just, hey. There's all there is is just problems standing in the way. And so on those calls, you know, people ask us questions like, oh, you know? Like, the one we'd had yesterday where someone was like, I'm not sure what to do with this lead source thing thing I've got.\n\nThen I'm like, okay. Well, here's how you solve that problem. And then, you know, you've got, like, four other people. Like, okay.\n\nI'm gonna do that as well. I'd have never even thought to ask that. I didn't even know it was a problem.\n\nSo often we have problems that we don't even know we have, and it takes other people to bring them up to recognize them. But you know, and even even in what you said there, to go back to your point, one of the things that you're gonna learn if you take this course and give it the time of day and and really actually work on it is how to scale, which I I had no idea of before.\n\nThat's probably where that light bulb moment came for me where I said, I actually can do this because I'm not doing six different things at the moment. I'm not I'm doing one thing. I'm trying to get really, really good at it. And the onboarding, one of the outreach is kinda copy and paste and it's done.\n\nThe onboarding can be copy and paste and it's done. The service that you're providing can be copy and paste because, you know, if it works for one, in my case, gym or fitness coach or PT, it's gonna work for another one. You tweak it and you scale up, and scale just becomes a numbers game. Cool.\n\nAnd if you figure it out, it becomes quite easy to understand at least.\n\nBecause what what I've learned about scale, in my limited experience, you know, because just getting to seven figures is a drop in the ocean. Right? And eight figures is the next step. But what what I've learned about scale is that it it really like, the the the main thing to scaling is just finding a proof of concept and then just repetition.\n\nSo people see scale once again as this weird abstract concept they can't explain or understand. They break down into two pieces.\n\nFinding something that gets the result you want and then just repeating that thing over and over and over and over again. And that's all there is to it. It's just but the proof of concept is where people slip up because, you know, people are like, oh, their their goal is to scale the agency. I wanna scale.\n\nI wanna scale. I wanna grow. But you can only scale something that you've proven to work on a micro level. If you want macro, you have to have micro, and then you have a fractal pattern.\n\nAnd we're gonna be recording videos on this, like, mindset wise and agency foundations wise and stuff because from a now that we've overseen, like, over a hundred and whatever it is people scale and grow with the program, we've sort of been able to really start to think about heuristics, so that'll become as well. But we should probably wrap up because it's god, it's been, like, forty minutes.\n\nBut, mate, it's been an absolute pleasure.\n\nAnd, you know, I'm really excited to see where you go next, and it'd be great to sit down next December and talk about how you've got to that, you know, point where you're basically receiving your old salary every month. And I think you'll probably get there a bit sooner if you can nail the service delivery.\n\nBut just just for the last sort of thing in closing, if you were a prospect of Empyrean and you were thinking about coming on board, knowing what you know now, what would you say to that person who's on the fence?\n\nOh, well well, knowing what I know now, it's it's obviously a no brainer. Right?\n\nIf I didn't know what I knew now, one year sales could probably get me. But if I could listen to if I could listen to a video like this, everything is there. Like I said, if you are serious about scale and agency and learning how to do it Mhmm. You can't fail with something like this.\n\nDo you know what I mean? That money back guarantee is is as good as gold because it's one hundred percent true. I think that if you put in what's what's there, you're it's gonna work. There's no there's no reason that it shouldn't work if you put the work in.\n\nAnd if something doesn't work, you are surrounded by support and people like minded people, yourself and Beau, who will help you get there. Do you know what I mean?\n\nIt's has to be the best course on the market for it. It has to be.\n\nI can't see how anything else good actually is.\n\nI always ask these questions, and I get all sort of, like, like, shy. I'm like, oh, it's still pity you. But I'm pretty sure, man.\n\nYeah. Listen. If you're on the fence, I I can't give you a reason why you shouldn't go for it. Just invest in it.\n\nYeah. It's gonna work.\n\nAppreciate it, man. That's awesome. Well, yeah, we'll we'll tie it up there. No doubt I'll talk to you again in six months or twelve months when you're even further ahead. If you can make the time for for me when you're so busy. You.\n\nBut, mate, it's been an absolute pleasure.\n\nAnd, yeah, I'll look forward to that. So for those of you guys who have tuned in to watch the video, couple of pieces of, next steps if you'd like. Subscribe if you like the video. Obviously, if you like the video, just press the like button. And, also, in the, description, you'll find two links. The first one will take you through to a funnel where you you can book a call for us to sell you exactly what we've used to get Jamie to get this result.\n\nAnd the second one will take you through to a Facebook group, which will be a softer approach where we'll introduce you to content and make you fall in love with all of our free stuff so you can buy our paid stuff eventually for full transparency.\n\nBut, yeah, Jamie, unless you've got anything else, Matt, I think we can wrap it up there. I think he might have disconnected.\n\nYou there, mate?","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/f6klcvmojw?autoplay=0&wmode=transparent&wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

Hi, everyone. It's Charlie Morgan, and welcome to another video. So today, I'm joined by a client of ours, Jamie, who started working with us. How long has it been, Jamie? Like, six months or something like that?\n\nYeah. Five, six months, I would say.\n\nFive or six wonderful months, basically.\n\nAnd when Jamie joined us, he was running an agency sort of full service. Then we're gonna sort of discuss what problems he had prior to working with us, mostly with acquisition and having focus and everything.\n\nAnd the the sort of moral of the story and the premise of today's video, is how Jamie's basically signed, like, I think it's, like, fifteen clients in the last month or something like that, which is pretty awesome.\n\nAnd we've been working with them, and we've we've basically helped Jamie systemize everything from client acquisition to onboarding to service delivery where he now has a really awesome business that basically just scales and is fully automated. So before we talk about, all of that, Jamie, why don't you just take a second to introduce yourself and tell the people about who you are and what you do and who you work with?\n\nYeah, man. So I'll I'll give you the somewhat long story so in case it might resonate with somebody. My name is Jamie Castle. I own Red Pig Media.\n\nWe're an agency, based in Ireland, and I suppose to give you the the background, I had I've worked in marketing for years. I've always worked in marketing.\n\nBefore starting this agency, I was I was a marketing manager for a large multinational here in Ireland. I had a couple of units around Ireland.\n\nDid it for a couple of years, ended up falling out of love with it, falling out of love with the corporate structure and the policies and having your creativity kinda hemmed in, being told what to do, you know, having to ask to go on holidays, all this kind of stuff. I hated it.\n\nSo pulled the trigger and handed my notice in January twenty twenty. Mhmm. Bought a one way ticket to Colombia for February twenty twenty. And when February twenty twenty came around, all flights were grounded.\n\nNobody was going anywhere. So it was the first time since I was thirteen years old that I didn't have a job. I always had a job, you know, after school, hard time, weekends, whatever. So this is the very, very first time, but it just seemed like the best opportunity to actually go for something and start something.\n\nI don't know why it it felt like a good decision, but it did.\n\nSo, yeah, I went for it. Kinda started to think about an agency. It meant it meant sense, seen as all I have ever done was marketing. So Mhmm. Created an agency, kind of launched it around August twenty twenty, but didn't make a red cent until December, twenty twenty. So, we're pretty much a year into actually, like, making money.\n\nAnd, yeah, ups and downs for sure.\n\nYou know, some good months at the start, some some shit months at the start.\n\nI don't know how you're gonna title this video, but there is a month March twenty twenty where I met five hundred quid. Yeah. And that that probably spans six weeks. That was probably more than than just the month that was the taking.\n\nSo I think it was March twenty twenty. So, ups and downs, some good months and bad months, but the the issue was we were offering everything. Yeah. It's it's not something that I'd ever even recommend to one of my clients.\n\nI think it's multiple porters. You can't be all thing to all people. That's exactly what I was trying to do.\n\nI think because most even entrepreneurs, freelancers that start out, it's the first time your your income is you're totally responsible for your income. Mhmm. So you're gonna take whatever comes your way. Mhmm.\n\nYou're gonna take jobs that you don't know how to do and figure out how to do them after you get them. So that's what we were doing. We're we're, you know, six or seven different types of services. There are six or seven different types of people involved and kind of contracted to me and working for me.\n\nYeah. So there was months where revenue was great, but profitably shit. Mhmm. And there was no systems in place at all at all.\n\nSo I had been talking to, like, other course providers or, like, people that help you kinda scale your system, this kind of stuff. Yeah. None none of them ever connected with me. You reached out.\n\nWe hopped on, and, yeah, everything you said kind of kind of made sense. It was what I was looking for. It was systems. Yep. It was kind of figuring out yeah. It was systems. It was kinda scaling back and learning how to be good at one thing.\n\nAnd I remember I don't know if you remember our sales call or not, but I remember calling you a bastard for selling to me so well. No.\n\nI think I do remember that, mate.\n\nYeah. Like, we we got you on board on that first call, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nYeah. And, and, yeah, I remember you saying something along those lines. You're like, gosh. You're too good at this. You bastard or something.\n\nYeah. It it like, it's the case. Like, I I read this all the time in business books or mindset books or whatever kind of self help books. You need to find somebody that's doing what you want to do and learn from them, which is exactly what you and Bo have done. You've scaled your agency already to whatever it is, multi multi seven figures.\n\nNow you're doing this, and I wanted to learn how to sell like you as well. I get I get that from quite a lot of people because, obviously, like, because we haven't had any prior case studies, personal brand, or ads to leverage for Empyreum, We've had to rely on cold email and our own sales skills.\n\nAnd, like, one of the main things we say from people is like they're like, how do I know your system works?\n\nI'm like, well, how did you hear about us and get on this call and get this close to giving us, like, all your money? And they're like, well, you'd sent me a cold email, and you've done a very, very good sales process.\n\nAnd I was like, well, if we can convince you to go through this process with us, how easy do you think it is for us to teach you how to do the same thing for other people who are far less skeptical than you are? So, yeah, I I get that, and I'm really glad you came on board because well, you know, the way the way I sell and the way we're teaching our reps to sell is it's like if you've got a product that can change someone's life, which I know this product does as evidenced by by us being here today, it's like you do everything you can to get them on board. Because it's like you've got a winning lottery ticket and you're and you're like, dude, I know if you buy this thing, then you'll get exactly what you want and more.\n\nAnd so, yeah, it's kind of a moral obligation for us to, like, to to sign people. So you you joined us, and you were offering loads of different services, and you had some good months revenue, but shit profit, and you had a month where you made five hundred dollars.\n\nAnd I remember so you you joined us about six months ago, but you've really only been using our outreach methods for about, what, three or four months because you had to sort of figure everything out first. Yeah. And so in in the last, well, since let's say since the start of November, so we're now about, you know, through November and into the middle of December here. So how many clients have you signed in the last couple of months?\n\nFive days if you'd like.\n\nYeah. So I suppose even on your point there, Mhmm.\n\nProbably one of the biggest turnarounds for me, one of the biggest kind of, moments for me in the actual course or making my way through the course was picking a niche.\n\nYeah.\n\nAgain, going back to what I said, we we had loads loads of clients and loads of different niches, loads of different industries, doing loads of different things for them.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo we actually weren't even really getting very good at anything or really getting any really good results for people.\n\nAnd it was just that kinda you you're kind of in limbo.\n\nSo it was kinda scary to think I need to pick a niche because you're kinda thinking, right, well, I'm gonna be hemmed in by this niche now and, you don't have to say no to other people and this kind of thing. But I think on one of the coaching calls, you said something that stuck me and I could butcher it now. But I think you kinda said the reason you pick a niche is so you can be broad.\n\nYou know, so I was kinda thinking, right, so I went in fit. Right?\n\nFinding abundance in scarcity.\n\nYeah. Something along those lines. It's like if you want to have you can't have everything, but you can have anything.\n\nYeah. Correct. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I picked fitness, right, because I had one or two clients in fitness.\n\nI like it myself as an industry. Yeah. I get on well with our clients because they're similar to me, I suppose, in in in a couple of different ways. Yeah.\n\nWhat happened when I actually that day when I picked it, it was like the weight was kind of lifted because I was like, okay. Now I know who I'm going for. Yep. Now I know how to serve them.\n\nNow I know how to speak to them. I can learn how to sell to them. I can learn how to you know, it's it just makes everything a whole lot easier.\n\nAnd when you do think about being broad in a niche, let's say fitness, I can now go after gyms, coaches, CrossFit, boot camps, running swimming trainers, whatever.\n\nAnd it's just it's just it's kind of a weight off when you actually make the when you actually make the decision.\n\nSo what was what was your initial question?\n\nI was just basically asking about how many clients you've signed, but I think you sort of went from, Yeah. From that question to sort of being more streamlined.\n\nBut, like, when you think about back in November to now Yeah.\n\nSo I had maybe one or two. And at the moment, it's looking like we're taking on an awful lot at the moment getting them onboarded for January because, obviously, January's gonna be crazy season. But it's looking like it'll be fifteen, probably sixteen active in January, I think, which is nuts. And the majority of them have come.\n\nLet's just sort of take a second because so you you had your previous agency where you were doing everything for everyone. It wasn't a business. You you were a glorified freelancer, basically. Everything was running through its chaos. You basically shut that down and started a new agency. And so you had basically, like, one client, as you mentioned, maybe two. And you've gone from one to two clients to sixteen paying clients with onboarding fees and pay per lead retainers over the course of what, like, four months, do you reckon?\n\nYeah. Probably about four months. That's fine. What's funny on that is the the very first month I did outreach, obviously, I was doing it all myself fine. I think I booked eighteen calls in the first month. Mhmm. And I think I sold one of them because my offer wasn't right.\n\nYeah. You know?\n\nAnd the outreach is working. I was getting calls. The calls were going really, really well.\n\nThis average from the program or Yeah.\n\nAverage from the program.\n\nThe first month. Yeah. The first month, everything was going well, and they were just on the edge of converting and selling, but I lost them all. Do you know what I mean?\n\nAnd it was just a case of the offer wasn't right. So I tweeted the second month, probably booked a similar amount of calls, and I think I got five out of that month or something like that. And it's funny because the offer we tweaked makes us more money, but it sounds Yeah. Yeah.\n\nIt's more it's more, incentivizing to the actual client to come on that way.\n\nWhy don't you quickly explain how you got went through that process of of creating the offer? Because in the program, we've obviously got that section that teaches you how to create your own sales argument and your own irresistible offer.\n\nDo you wanna quickly touch on on how that helps you through that process?\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know, there's so much in that module that kind of there's almost a checklist of all the stuff you need to have and offer.\n\nYou know, a guarantee, especially incentive based pricing.\n\nA lot of mine came from actual testing.\n\nThe the very first time I tested my sales script was I think you I don't know if you remember, and I I tested with a friend of mine who is in fitness. And I said, I wanted to test his screen.\n\nSo well he called you back up to buy afters. Yeah. Go on. Go on. Tell tell him.\n\nIt's yeah. I I rang him up and said, listen. I'm going into fitness. I have this thing built.\n\nIt's pretty much ready to go, and I just wanna test the script with you. Do you know what I mean? I'm not gonna I'm not trying to sell you anything. I just wanna see what you think of the script.\n\nYeah. And it works so well.\n\nHe had his camera on. I had my camera off. And when you go into the area of creating a little bit of pain for them so they can understand where they need to get to from where they are now, and you place yourself as a vehicle for them to get there. I could see their script working in his face, and I could see the way he was thinking. I could see everything working. Yeah. I was thinking, shit.\n\nThis is That's the the script you used from the program and edited a little.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt's the script I still use now. So, yeah, he called me back and said, you know what? I actually wanna actually wanna come on with you. We said we'd leave it for a couple of months until, you know, everything's good.\n\nThis improved concept first. Yeah. Descriptive is absolutely and it is absolutely insane. You know?\n\nSo the offer probably came from a lot of book was that month of trials and fails. And for one, okay. That actually doesn't work. Mhmm.\n\nBeautiful thing about failing is you've kind of known out what doesn't work. You can test something else.\n\nAnd it looks like we've kinda found, you know, a winning strategy that I'm sure I'm gonna keep tweaking and have already started tweaking to make it even better for us and for them.\n\nBut I suppose that's how that that offer kind of got created. It was obviously through your course, gives you the blueprint. Mhmm. And then you I suppose you kinda bring it to market and and test it yourself. And that's another beautiful thing about the course is you teach us how to create it for ourselves.\n\nSo it's not Yeah.\n\nThere's no sort of copy and paste element of it because that that never works, like, in the long term. So that makes sense. So when in terms of the appointment flow you've currently got because I think because in in the program, we've got, like, six or seven methods for you to book appointments, but you're only using one of them. How many appointments are you booking right now per per week per month? Is it, like like, ten ten per week or some five per week or something similar, like one or two a day or something?\n\nYeah. So it it kinda started off like I said, that first month was was eighteen or so. But I was doing all of the outreach myself. Everything was everything again was through me, and I kinda wanted to take it to kind of the ten k per month mark before I started getting VAs and before just so I knew that it worked. I wanted to learn it as well as I possibly could before I would teach somebody else.\n\nSo at the moment, you know, we're booking over ten over ten calls a week, I would say. Yeah. Pretty easily. Yeah.\n\nSo And that's all automated as well.\n\nIt's all automated. And to be honest with you, Charlie, that was one of the first times I felt like an actual business owner. Right? Because, yeah, glorified freelancer for sure. Everything going through me, kind of making up as you go along. Yeah.\n\nBut when you can have people in place and they're doing their job for you and I can go to bed at night and wake up and there's gonna be ten more emails of people saying that they're interested in my offer, and then you start to feel like, okay. Shit.\n\nI am actually this is That's when like, that's that's one of the one of the best feelings because we did this with Northwell with our agency, like, three and a half years, four years ago when we really started to get the appointment booking thing right.\n\nAnd I remember that I can't remember, but it was like a weekend. And I went to bed this Friday night, and it's the first time that someone else had booked a call for me that was inside of the agency, so not like an external done for you appointment booker.\n\nAnd we built this system, and I I woke up on Saturday, and and I looked at my calendar. Well, I got an email from Calendly, and I booked two calls just over the over the night. And that's when I was like, fuck. That's, like, that's a good feeling. So I resonate with that, man. Just be waiting till you get a sales rep, then you start closing sales without even having to blink. It's like Yeah.\n\nLike, I mean, it's it's a crazy place to be in now so fast, but I know now from what I've learned in the course, the stuff that's already in place, outreach and client acquisition is probably never going to be an issue for me again. I I think it's going to be easy for me to get clients. If I ever needed to shut it off and turn it on again, I think it's gonna be pretty much as easy as that.\n\nBecause this is what Kethu said as well, who the last person who I interviewed just so everybody has the context of that on on the channel.\n\nAnd you you you're talking to us about the same issue he's facing where it's like, I've now got I now know now that I've solved acquisition, the problem I have is operation based, and sort of systemizing that. And so we we've helped you with the process of finding media buyers and system Imperium and they just think appointment booking, but the systems work so fucking well that the problem is no longer appointment booking once you've used them. So do you wanna sort of touch base on what your next steps are? What you think you need to systemize beyond beyond what you're currently doing?\n\nYeah. So, yeah, it's crazy because that outreach thing, it does seem sorted. My sales skills, I think, are up to a point now where I feel very comfortable selling to somebody.\n\nI feel also very comfortable telling somebody that they're not a right fit for us, which is Well, those those two things are basically the same.\n\nAs soon as you get comfortable enough to say to someone, I don't wanna work with you or you're not a good fit, that's when you know, like, you're on you're on on the right track. But yeah. Go on.\n\nYeah. So the next thing, yeah, is service delivery. Right? And and trying to put a system in there where not so much that is automated, but so that it you know that it's good.\n\nYou know that you're shit out on it. The next steps for my agency like, I wouldn't say that it's a certain figure per month. The next steps for me and and our agency is to get is to be one of the best at what we're doing and to to figure out a service delivery that's shit hot, and it gets all of our clients really, really good results. That's That's what the next steps is first.\n\nThat's what I'm gonna be focusing on now and in next year. And obviously, money comes with that and clients come with that anyway. But it's nice to be in a position where you can actually focus on that. So, yeah, through the course, outreach is done.\n\nSales is pretty much dialed in. Mhmm. And onboarding at the moment is is pretty much getting systemized and getting it down very, very fast at least.\n\nI have media buyers on board now, So it's a case of I can I can't take my eyes off it or anything like that, but Mhmm? It's all starting to come into place. And you probably said it as well either in one of the modules or in one of the coaching calls. Mhmm. And it's took me, and it's kinda one of my plans is that I can have a business that is automated in the beginning.\n\nI do a sales call. The service delivery is automated, and all I'm doing is jumping on sales calls and scaling my business constantly.\n\nSo that's the point where I'm trying to get I think the first half of it is done.\n\nThe second half of it now is is definitely the next part, which Yeah.\n\nBecause I think that's that's the sort of thing I wanna do to focus on when you joined us.\n\nBecause, obviously, we we planned like, you kind of it's like you've got the same you're trading under the same business you were prior to working with us, but you've got a totally different agency. And so we shot we shut one down to start a new one. And, ironically, you've scaled this new one in more in three months than the previous one you had over, like, three years or something crazy like that.\n\nAnd it really is just niche selection and building service delivery and onboarding. So you are like the chain, the link between these two facets of the service delivery and onboarding.\n\nSo you are like the chain, the link between these two facets of the business. And then eventually, it's hiring a sales rep. Because because once you've got acquisition, sales, and service delivery and support systemize, you don't really have to do anything. And that's that's what we've been able to do with Northwell to a degree.\n\nLike, you just have key members of your team, and then you just talk to them every week, and they just do their jobs.\n\nBut it's impossible to get to that point because people want automation without proof of concept. And so I see this all the time where people like, oh, I want I wanna scale my agency and use automated systems, and I'm gonna hire a media buyer and a sales rep, and and I'm gonna do all this automated stuff. And it's like, well, you've kind of gotta figure it out yourself before you can pass it on to someone else, and you're in the process of doing that. So that's awesome. Yeah.\n\nIt's not it's not, what's that saying?\n\nIt's not a golden bullet or whatever they say it is.\n\nYeah. Silver bullet or something like that.\n\nLike that.\n\nIt's a shit like golden pill and silver bullet, so you were close.\n\nOkay.\n\nI think it was a pale, golden bullet.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Like, you guys would teach you the strategies, but it's not it's not gonna happen without the hard work. Do you know what I mean? Instead of putting crazy long days, but probably the most important thing out of this whole course coming on with you guys is not so much all the stuff that you learned because it's all a sum of the parts.\n\nFor me, the most important thing that I was able to take away from it was, I suppose, the realization that I can fucking do this. Do you know what I mean? And this can actually be a business and an agency that I can grow to a certain point where it's life changing. Do you know what I mean?\n\nMhmm. I always knew that there was something there. I didn't know what it was. I didn't know how to get there.\n\nI knew that if I could find it, I have the the, like, the self belief in the the work ethic to actually go after it and get it. Mhmm. But it's realizing that I can actually fucking do it.\n\nI think this is Right.\n\nThe first step to to making, like, real progress is recognizing possibility.\n\nBecause it's like it's not in because when it's like with all the stuff we teach in the program and the methods we teach, and people are like, no way you can book appointments with that or no way you can close with that script or I don't think it's possible to to go because, like, you know, you've gone from zero to multi six figures in literally three months, three or four months, right, since you started the new agency if you projected your revenue every year. And to most business people, like, if you said, yeah, hey. You can start a business that goes from zero to, like, two hundred k a year in three months with margins of, like, sixty to eighty percent, they'd be like, no fucking way. There's no way you can do that. But why the hell not? All you could all kind of all you have to do is be crazy enough to believe that something that that's possible and then, you know, learn from people that have done it.\n\nLearn from people that have done it. Yeah. A hundred percent. I think I I don't know if I've said this to you before.\n\nI think I've said it to other people, and don't get offended when I say it. But this course is like how to build a successful agency for dummies because everything is there. Like, literally everything's there. You can't fail if you if you put all the stuff in, if you follow it, if you work hard, you can't fail.\n\nEspecially with, like, the support of you guys, the support of everyone that's in the actual group. The coaching calls, everything is there.\n\nIt shows you how to To let you in on the secret so we've we're in the process of now we've we've got a hundred and fifty people in the group.\n\nWe've probably signed anywhere between, like, hundred and twenty to a hundred and thirty agencies because, obviously, there's a few extra people as a business partners and team members. But out of the hundred and whatever it is we've signed so far, we haven't had a single dispute or we haven't had to process a single full refund or anything like that. Because, obviously, everyone comes on board with the full money back guarantee.\n\nBut we're like, look.\n\nIf you don't make your money back, we'll give you a full refund. But you gotta do the work, and we haven't had one person come to us and ask for a full refund, which is amazing. They're not one dispute, which is kind of weird. And we'll we'll we'll get one. You know, we'll have one every now and then, but it's like the the the weird thing about about us, Jamie, and the the program is that we know it's the best, but we're also terrified that it's not good enough. So we've already got, we've already got plans for next year where we're gonna really, like, it's gonna be, like, three times better than it currently is, which is which is kind of awesome.\n\nAnd we're gonna be spending a lot of time working on it because, you know, right now, like you said, everything's in there, but we want more. Like, I want everyone to be able to hop in and, you know, just add, like, twenty k to their revenue in, like, three months, similar to you've done almost.\n\nBut, like, I've often, I've often told a bunch of money back guarantee.\n\nRight? And I I can't remember what the actual stipulations are if if it's not in a certain time frame or something like that. But once you actually get in to the course and once you actually start doing it, you're like you're like, I'm asking for a refund then. Yeah.\n\nYou'd be like, look. I might not make my money back if I don't put it in right now. It doesn't really matter. The shit that I'm learning here is worth ten times what I paid for the course.\n\nSo I I can't see how anyone would actually come back and say, I want my money back.\n\nYeah. I think, like, you know, it's once people hop in because so many people have been burned by programs before, And I don't know if you've taken courses before this, but I know you were talking to a few people about agency scaling, even just saying it makes my skin crawl because it has such a negative connotation.\n\nBut, like, you know, what we recognized is that I've I mean, with Northwell, we probably invested, like, twenty, thirty, forty grand in courses. Right? And then all the odd one's helpful, but none of them are really super needle moving courses except from anything by Sam Evans. That man's a fucking genius.\n\nAnd so we looked at the the market, and we thought, well, what if we just do what needs to be done? And we actually put together, like, an entire like, it's gonna suck when it's it sucked to record all those videos and stuff. But we have people who hop in and, like, within the first, like, week, we get messages from them saying, thank you for closing me, which is like like, thank you for taking my money. And that's not like a cocky thing from from our perspective, though I'm quite proud of that.\n\nBut, you know, I just we we sort of thought we looked at the industry, and we were like, god. We need to clean this up because there's so much bullshit out there.\n\nAnd, I'm not gonna ask I mean, do you mind me asking already? You don't so much money, spend so much money on courses, it's not in the other. What what what was it for you guys that actually moved the needle? Is it just mentorship with the people that, you know, have done what you're trying to get to?\n\nWhere is it where that you guys kind of Well, the the the the the one person that has moved the needle for us is is Sam Evans.\n\nThat's from an info product perspective and also an agency perspective. Sam Evans is he's an absolute genius. We're we're gonna do his, Quantum Mastermind either this coming year or next year, which is about, like, forty grand or something, and we're gonna go to that.\n\nBut up level consulting is really helpful. Consulting accelerator. But the main thing that's moved the needle for Bo and I collectively through not only getting Northwell to seven figures, but now Imperium to seven figures in pretty much, like, twelve months is mindset.\n\nAnd it's just it's just the belief systems that we've had and developed, and the identities that we've sort of grown into. Because, like, that that's really the thing that moved the needle for us. The strategies and the processes and the the techniques that you need to learn, they all they're all out there for you to just realize, but the first thing is to sort of think, right, I'm the kind of person that can make this really easy.\n\nAnd so, like, we're we're sort of having to grow Imperium now. We wanna go from, you know, high six figures to seven figures, then multi seven figures and eight figures, and that process is purely mindset.\n\nAnd so that's the main thing. And we're gonna be doing a mindset module for the program because we've realized, like, fuck, it's the most important thing, but it's taken us a year to put it together.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And there's a lot of there's a lot of gold dust in terms of mindset in your sales module in there as well. Yeah.\n\nLike I said, that the most important thing was maybe me realizing that I could bring this to a certain level. Probably the second most important thing that I've learned from the course was your sales, module because it's so applicable to life. Mhmm. If you understand how to sell something or if you understand how to handle objections, you probably understand the human psyche a little bit more.\n\nOh, god. Yeah.\n\nAnd it's it's It feeds into everything, aren't it?\n\nKnowing how, like because, really, when you think about, like, an agency or most most companies, really, it's just knowing how to deal with people and getting them to do what you want or getting them to do with what you know is within their best interests, but allows them to grow and allows you to make money.\n\nAnd that's why, like, I think the the thing that springboarded me specifically towards the growth that we've had was my apprenticeship doing cold calls. And I had to make, like, you know, hundred and fifty cold calls a day for, like, eighteen months straight or, like, a year straight.\n\nAnd that was just like because because when because what I realized when we were doing cold calls in the office, and there was two types of people in in the office. One was the person who just did the calls with no enthusiasm, and they basically just, like, hated it. But the other person was the person who hated it, but also actually tried. And it was just by sort of just trying every call, just having that little inflection in your voice or just making the extra call here and there that made it fun because then you get more results.\n\nIronically, everybody whose side got fired anyway, but, yeah, the cold calling man was the was the thing. But, anyway, back to you. So what what what's your plan now? Because I think January, you're probably gonna have, like, a twenty five k month, to be honest with you, because, you know, you're working on performance with pay per lead stuff. Because, you know, that's the cool model as well. But what's your plan?\n\nIt's, it's hard to look at that and and see that as a potential income for a month.\n\nWell, I believe it's for you already.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nI I know that believe so far for you has been right.\n\nYeah. Yeah. No.\n\nWe'll report back, you know, in in a month's time, and and we'll see how we do. But we have onboarded so many people now that if we can deliver, we will one hundred percent be at that point. Mhmm. Like I said, it's at the moment, thankfully, I'm in a in a place where I'm I'm not too worried about finances or sales coming in because I know I can get it.\n\nRight? I know I can get pretty much clients on autopilot now, which is insane. Yeah. It's more so trying to focus on being the best at it, trying to be trying to focus on being the best at the service delivery and getting all of our clients really, really, really good results.\n\nThat's what I'm most worried about at the moment because I know the first half of the equation is done.\n\nIn terms of finance, I I did say to you that one of my goals was to do a thirty six and a half thousand month. Mhmm. That was my previous salary in a job that I felt under undervalued in anyway. Yeah. It would be amazing to kinda do that in in a month. It would be absolutely insane to do it in a month.\n\nIt's trending that way, and I know that, with consistency, it will it will end up going that way Mhmm. With you like, you guys are stuck with me now as well. Any problems I'm gonna have?\n\nWell, it's it's kind of like we we quite enjoy it, man. Mhmm. Because it's we we get to watch you go through the process that we've had to go through for for two businesses.\n\nAnd it you know, it's a nice sort of, there's an element of empathy to it, I suppose, where you can be like, what what do I do? And we're like, well, this is exactly what you do because we remember that quite clearly.\n\nAnd, you know, we do that for all of our clients, obviously, and, you know, you've got the the weekly coaching calls. And the interesting thing and I was I was looking at, because I got interviews with, Ishmael coming up and another guy called Martin, you know, people who have also added, you know, like, multi six figures over the course of, like, a few months of working with us. And, like, I've looked at the underlying sort of thing trying to figure out, like, what do all these people have in common?\n\nAnd it's the coaching calls.\n\nLike, you've been on those ones religiously. Not all of them every week, twice a week, but more often than not, you're on those calls.\n\nWe can't get rid of you.\n\nI mean, don't get me wrong. I love it.\n\nBut, like, I think that the fact that you've just stuck to those and worked hard as a testament because we can give you the content, but if you don't do the work, so you should be proud, man, because you've done They're they're I said in one of my recent posts in the thing, they're they're just full of, like, they're just full of golden nuggets.\n\nThey're just they're insane because something that somebody has struggling with. Either you have struggled with it, you are struggling with it, or you will. Mhmm. And there's so much that you can pick up from what what else, what other people are actually saying on those calls.\n\nThe advice you guys are given like, I I could be working away on one screen. I have the quote and call another screen. Just listen. Some of them just write it down.\n\nYeah. Just put it around.\n\nWe don't like scaling an agency is is really just solving a collection of problems.\n\nAnd, like, problems manifest themselves as questions which people ask us, and then we provide answers which are solutions. And if you have all the solutions, then you know what to do, more actions to take to put cause to effect to get to seven figures. That's all there is to it, and people overcomplicate it. And they think this getting to seven figures or multi six figures or their goal is this, you know, weird abstract thing, and it's all gray, and they can't see what they're doing, what they need to do.\n\nBut, really, you just recognize it's just, hey. There's all there is is just problems standing in the way. And so on those calls, you know, people ask us questions like, oh, you know? Like, the one we'd had yesterday where someone was like, I'm not sure what to do with this lead source thing thing I've got.\n\nThen I'm like, okay. Well, here's how you solve that problem. And then, you know, you've got, like, four other people. Like, okay.\n\nI'm gonna do that as well. I'd have never even thought to ask that. I didn't even know it was a problem.\n\nSo often we have problems that we don't even know we have, and it takes other people to bring them up to recognize them. But you know, and even even in what you said there, to go back to your point, one of the things that you're gonna learn if you take this course and give it the time of day and and really actually work on it is how to scale, which I I had no idea of before.\n\nThat's probably where that light bulb moment came for me where I said, I actually can do this because I'm not doing six different things at the moment. I'm not I'm doing one thing. I'm trying to get really, really good at it. And the onboarding, one of the outreach is kinda copy and paste and it's done.\n\nThe onboarding can be copy and paste and it's done. The service that you're providing can be copy and paste because, you know, if it works for one, in my case, gym or fitness coach or PT, it's gonna work for another one. You tweak it and you scale up, and scale just becomes a numbers game. Cool.\n\nAnd if you figure it out, it becomes quite easy to understand at least.\n\nBecause what what I've learned about scale, in my limited experience, you know, because just getting to seven figures is a drop in the ocean. Right? And eight figures is the next step. But what what I've learned about scale is that it it really like, the the the main thing to scaling is just finding a proof of concept and then just repetition.\n\nSo people see scale once again as this weird abstract concept they can't explain or understand. They break down into two pieces.\n\nFinding something that gets the result you want and then just repeating that thing over and over and over and over again. And that's all there is to it. It's just but the proof of concept is where people slip up because, you know, people are like, oh, their their goal is to scale the agency. I wanna scale.\n\nI wanna scale. I wanna grow. But you can only scale something that you've proven to work on a micro level. If you want macro, you have to have micro, and then you have a fractal pattern.\n\nAnd we're gonna be recording videos on this, like, mindset wise and agency foundations wise and stuff because from a now that we've overseen, like, over a hundred and whatever it is people scale and grow with the program, we've sort of been able to really start to think about heuristics, so that'll become as well. But we should probably wrap up because it's god, it's been, like, forty minutes.\n\nBut, mate, it's been an absolute pleasure.\n\nAnd, you know, I'm really excited to see where you go next, and it'd be great to sit down next December and talk about how you've got to that, you know, point where you're basically receiving your old salary every month. And I think you'll probably get there a bit sooner if you can nail the service delivery.\n\nBut just just for the last sort of thing in closing, if you were a prospect of Empyrean and you were thinking about coming on board, knowing what you know now, what would you say to that person who's on the fence?\n\nOh, well well, knowing what I know now, it's it's obviously a no brainer. Right?\n\nIf I didn't know what I knew now, one year sales could probably get me. But if I could listen to if I could listen to a video like this, everything is there. Like I said, if you are serious about scale and agency and learning how to do it Mhmm. You can't fail with something like this.\n\nDo you know what I mean? That money back guarantee is is as good as gold because it's one hundred percent true. I think that if you put in what's what's there, you're it's gonna work. There's no there's no reason that it shouldn't work if you put the work in.\n\nAnd if something doesn't work, you are surrounded by support and people like minded people, yourself and Beau, who will help you get there. Do you know what I mean?\n\nIt's has to be the best course on the market for it. It has to be.\n\nI can't see how anything else good actually is.\n\nI always ask these questions, and I get all sort of, like, like, shy. I'm like, oh, it's still pity you. But I'm pretty sure, man.\n\nYeah. Listen. If you're on the fence, I I can't give you a reason why you shouldn't go for it. Just invest in it.\n\nYeah. It's gonna work.\n\nAppreciate it, man. That's awesome. Well, yeah, we'll we'll tie it up there. No doubt I'll talk to you again in six months or twelve months when you're even further ahead. If you can make the time for for me when you're so busy. You.\n\nBut, mate, it's been an absolute pleasure.\n\nAnd, yeah, I'll look forward to that. So for those of you guys who have tuned in to watch the video, couple of pieces of, next steps if you'd like. Subscribe if you like the video. Obviously, if you like the video, just press the like button. And, also, in the, description, you'll find two links. The first one will take you through to a funnel where you you can book a call for us to sell you exactly what we've used to get Jamie to get this result.\n\nAnd the second one will take you through to a Facebook group, which will be a softer approach where we'll introduce you to content and make you fall in love with all of our free stuff so you can buy our paid stuff eventually for full transparency.\n\nBut, yeah, Jamie, unless you've got anything else, Matt, I think we can wrap it up there. I think he might have disconnected.\n\nYou there, mate?"}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}}, {});
