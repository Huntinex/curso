Hello, everybody. My name is Oscar. I work for Charlie Morgan at Imperium or Easy Garage, I should say.\n\nI just got finished with a client interview with a client of ours. His name is Carlos Campos. He's managed to scale his coaching business from twenty k to forty five k per month, literally in the span of ten months of working with us.\n\nLike, his main problem when he hopped on board, it was the two appointment setting, and now he's booking, like, over five appointments every single day, which is pretty awesome.\n\nSo, yeah, let's just hop into the client interview. It's an awesome one, and, yeah, I'll see you on the other side. Cheers.\n\nAlright, everybody. I am here with Carlos, who is a client of ours in EZUgo. Carlos, he came on board with us about what was that now? Like, ten months ago in May of last year twenty twenty three. And in that time period when you came on board, you're doing about, like, an average twenty k per month. And at this moment in time, you're averaging out at about forty five k per month, with the business.\n\nSo Carlos, if you can just, like, tell a little bit about yourself, like, what you're doing in the business and, yeah, just give a little bit of an introduction.\n\nSo, yeah, my name is Carlos Campos, and my gorgeous wife, Chantelle. She and I do marriage mastery.\n\nOur our movement is Epic Your Life Movement, of course, creating extraordinary.\n\nBut our niche is marriage mastery, and and so we work with we collaborate with, you know, people and and, influencers to create extraordinary.\n\nSo myself, my wife, our our specialty is in marriage and helping people to get married. Matter of fact, in the weeks next weekend, we'll be officiating a wedding that we help, two singles come together and get married through our process. But, also, we have, as you can see back here, couples that, that are already married, had kids, and we help them have epic marriages. So that's our niche as marriage mastery, bro.\n\nOkay. So it's essentially like you your coach when it comes to marriage. Like, what should I call it?\n\nYeah. Just a coach in marriage.\n\nYeah. I mean, we're an expert in in helping people to master the relationship of marriage, which is we have found is really beneficial on all levels.\n\nBut, really, it's through full immersion at our retreats because we host small retreats, small intimate retreats, and they're all inclusive. And then we also do mentorship where we support, and we we motivate and, help people to in their relationship skills. And then we also have, connection through a Mentor Connect app. And our our main thing that we help people with, it that we found three skills that they need to develop and we support them in developing this is confidence, communication, and commitment. It's our three c's of connection. That's that's what we do here, and that's what where where our results come from, for sure.\n\nFair. Fair. And so you came on board in about May last year. What was sort of like, when you're doing twenty k per month, what was sort of the main reason behind you coming on board and booking a call with us, like, back in May?\n\nYeah, man. When when I spoke to you, it's like, I just we're we need leads.\n\nWe need something because we have, like, we know we have a good product. We know we have good results. We literally, you know, had everything we needed. We felt like but we just we weren't getting the eyeballs. We weren't getting the attention, and you guys opened some doors for us that we hadn't been able to open before then.\n\nOkay. And when you say leads, is that is that essentially just, like, qualified appointments?\n\nTrue. Like, you know, we we weren't even doing very many as you call strategy calls or consultations with people to then evolve into a sale. Right? We weren't getting but one or two a week, and and we needed some kind of strategy or some kind of system because we're very good at following a system or a strategy, but we just couldn't find one that was working for us.\n\nAnd that could be easy and simple, and easy to apply and just follow directions. And, fortunately, we found you guys. Right? I'm so glad you you reached out to me, and you were persisting.\n\nYou used the very system on me that closed me.\n\nBut I used either did I still do the appointment setting back then?\n\nI'm not quite too sure. Who who sent you a message? Do you remember?\n\nWell, I thought it was you back then, wasn't it? Or maybe it was one of your assistants or maybe, actually, it was whoever it was, I think you closed me, if I remember right. Yeah.\n\nBut it was it was someone talking to me through, and It was supposed to be it was supposed to be a DM also a DM's like what we told you guys.\n\nRight?\n\nFor sure. Yeah. Okay. But through through what's his name's messaging, I don't know why it's saying Charlie.\n\nCharlie's Charlie Morgan's messenger. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nOkay. So you're saying, like, the main thing that was sort of sort of getting more leads. I mean, what did this business look like back then? You're saying, like, you needed more leads. What were you doing back then for for booking those appointments and getting those leads?\n\nYeah. That's literally organic and just referrals and trying to call clients and connect with them to get referrals and trying to do some things on Facebook, but not very successful, trying to do organic, get organic leads through Facebook Messenger and things like that. But we didn't have near the system when you guys had, but we kinda had an idea of that, but definitely not the strategy that you guys introduced us to. That made all the difference.\n\nOkay. And so you come on board.\n\nYep. You sort of you sort of, like, see the program in front of you. How how did you decide what to start picking?\n\nWell, I tell you, the low hanging fruit for us, when I went through it, Charlie's brilliant in the way he presents the content and the course, and a lot of it's mindset. And I did. I just stayed the course and went through it. But when I hit DM sorcery, that's where I stopped.\n\nBecause we had started doing some of that already, but we didn't do it with the the the the skill and strategy that you guys put together with that. It is really, really awesome. So that's really what caught us. And then, man, we went to work and implemented because it was low hanging fruit for us because we're already doing somewhat of that process, but definitely not the hybrid that you guys introduced us to.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo you started with the DM Sorcerer. Remember, if I'm not mistaken, you posted, like, a win in the community, like, within, I don't know how long, but you post, like, one of those very high ticket deals, didn't you? Like, within the get go.\n\nAbsolutely. And it was definitely through the DM sorcery because we were not yeah. We were doing, like, twenty k. And so then it bounced up to sixty k that first month, and we're just like, woah. They we're definitely on something for sure.\n\nMhmm. And what then happened, like, you have this system.\n\nI guess, like, at least one of the things that I'm hearing a lot is, like, what people want is they want predictable systems that they can turn on and off, and then they just know they get quality appointments booked.\n\nThe thing that then comes into place whether they can then deliver and whether they have to pause and start and pause and start. Right? That's been a whole lot of thing. But do you feel like you've gotten that system that you can pause and start and then you just know they're gonna come in, or how does that look?\n\nSo there's definitely been that. Right? Getting the whole because then there's fulfillment. And that's why I've noticed, like, it's for us, it was a cycle.\n\nLike, we would have a big month, like, sixty thousand. It's like, oh, dang. We gotta do fulfillment because they're big packages. Right?\n\nSo as we have, developed our team and really created a better system, now we're getting that consistency, consistency, consistency. And instead of having, like, a sixty thousand dollar a month and then a twenty thousand dollar a month, which is I mean, it's common in business, but now we're really, really seeing the consistency of about forty five k a month, which we're super pumped about. And it's no longer this this surge. Again, because we've implemented the DM sorcery and got the consistency of that and then also the fulfillment side of it as well because that was a struggle, to be honest.\n\nLike, the the fulfillment was like, oh, crap. Okay. Now we gotta do the fulfillment on these big packages with our clients, and it's a lot of commitment on our part, like, to to fulfill. It's there's a reason it's a big package.\n\nAnd so that was the thing was like, okay. We have the same flex of cash flow, but now we've really dialed in the subscription model on a smaller basis, but more every month, every month, every month, and it's paid off big time. So that's what we're super pumped about is is having that forty five k, but having it in staying, not the fluctuation. Like, we averaged forty five, but there was a lot of fluctuation.\n\nWhere now it's just this consistent rise, man. Like, ten to fifteen to twenty percent every month, and we're building off of it, which I'm super grateful. And all literally, we still just use focused on Tim's for three. That may not be what people wanna hear sometimes because but that's I I I have to give kudos to what you guys have done with Easy Grow and Charlie. Seriously, Charlie Morgan is an an amazing The team you guys have there in developing this because just with one, we've been able to create that kind of income. We know if we start implementing all these other ones, or working with people that do the better at this because we again, our niche, that's what we realized too is we wanna focus on what we do in our marriage mastery instead of being a lead generator. But we have been able to do that just through our d m sour DM sorcery and still not outsourcing anything yet.\n\nBut that Okay. Through the plan Yes.\n\nSo you haven't even outsourced anything, especially just you and your wife still doing the.\n\nNo. I'm saying outsourcing as far as hiring any kind of lead generation company or working with anybody else to do our marketing or ads. We're still just you our DM sorcery in house and and applying what you taught us to get it to the the stability and the consistent growth now.\n\nOkay. And when you're talking about sort of, like, you only haven't used one of the strategies, are you planning to hop into some of the paid app strategies or some of the other strategies we've got in the future? What does the future hold?\n\nWell, you know, we've been looking at them.\n\nBut I don't want see, this is where then I I I struggle with, and your group and your team there at Easy Grow does provide ways to outsource it because I'm really good at what I do with the relationships.\n\nSo we've worked on the DM Sourcery, and it fits for what we do in relationships and and connect with our clients and old clients, existing clients, and then new clients. We it's all appropriate using DM Sourcery. When it comes into the ads and creating the and doing that stuff, we have we're kind of dabbling in it, seeing if we wanna do it, but we realized, like, we're probably gonna have to have someone committed just to that to start implementing your other stuff. Does that make sense?\n\nOkay. I get you.\n\nSo, like, the main thing you've used is DM source, and you also talked a little bit about the mindset. I guess, like, from you having gone through some of the parts of the program, what do you feel like was the most valuable thing to you? It could be DMs also. It could be mindset. It could be a third thing. What what do you feel was, like, most bang for the buck?\n\nI mean and the support of the community. There's no doubt. Like, it's incredible support, like, the feed there, and I can always jump on there and do a search and find the information that I need. And people are asking similar questions that I have.\n\nThere's answers there. There's really good, like, support through the community and through people like you. Oscar, you guys are always attentive to to answer questions and connect with us. It's really powerful to have that kind of support, through the community.\n\nBut, also, yes, DM Sorcher, I'd have to say, one thing about what what he did, the the the mindset thing about going through the fire, like, that was really in the pain. That is one thing that I will tell you was a new perspective that I've never ever heard from someone, and I really have applied it to my own life and to with our clients actually of expressing how important pain is and recognizing the way that, you know, he talks about pain in the mindset stuff and that it's essential for growth and development was really a cool perspective.\n\nAnd that was, like, my big takeaway for the mindset stuff because I've been through a lot of that, but that was one thing that really uniquely stood out to me. And then number two, definitely the DM sorcery and the system and strategy that was absolutely laid out brilliantly. You just gotta follow the steps and do it. And then even just to tell you too, even refining our messaging because I love and appreciate that.\n\nLike, we had done that. We had set up our avatar and those things. However, it was really good to go back through it through this system, and make it better. And I continue to actually do that, use, you know, a lot of the the strategies that Charlie talks about to refine your avatar, refine your business and what you do and who you serve and all those things and how you do it.\n\nLike, it's all really well laid out there and which helps in your messaging for marketing. So we've definitely refined that in the last since June and I since I got started with you guys, I've definitely used that multiple times to continue and improve our messaging and our and our our because that's part of it. Like, DM Sorcery is great, but our refinement or messaging has come through this process with Charlie of the of that refinement, right, and understanding your market and continuing to use that, like, has really made a huge difference to where now we're getting even better results and more people responding to DM sorcery because we we have refined our message and made it better and simpler, simpler, simpler, simpler, like, you know, just like marriage mastery.\n\nThat's what we refined it down to.\n\nYou know, when when Epic Your Life is our movement, but what we do in our niche is is creating is marriage mastery and creating epic marriages if you wanna use that. So it's really helped a lot, and I'm super grateful because that was a big part of it too as well and to see our success and continued success. Because one thing to have flash in the pan, it's another thing to maintain it and keep it going, and that's what we've been able to do.\n\nYeah. I guess, like, that's the main thing for you. Like, you've been able to hit more consistency. Like, I lost more consistency as you said. So, like, now you're doing forty five k per month. What's the plan moving forward? We've talked about a hundred k a month before, but, I mean, like, what what does the future look like?\n\nI mean, it's more real than ever now because what we're doing is more sustainable.\n\nWe're finding out that, again, the bigger packages take a little bit more trust and time. We admittedly, we sold those to people that had been ex as we did our research, they've been exposed to us for a couple years, right, and and and plugging in. So we knew there was that's where we built the trust. So it's real.\n\nLike, I'm not saying we can't sell it, but now we're almost when we were we know our numbers. Like, on our big packages, we were selling about twenty four, twenty five percent. You'd be like, wow. Just get more leads.\n\nI agree. However, like, the more leads we got, that percentage kept going down and down because it's such a high package.\n\nThat's still good. We could still get more leads, and that'd be great. But now now that we've refined our message and we've we've developed our packages and have more options for our clientele all around marriage mastery, we actually are, like, ninety percent closing ratio because we have something for everyone. And as, you know, I know, Charlie says and so does, you know, Alex or Mosey, there's a reason why they got on the call with you.\n\nThey want to do something. Otherwise, they wouldn't have got on the call with you. So that's what we've really been able to do is perfect the messaging and even perfect our packaging thanks to what Charlie's helped us with for sure in that mindset and that process. And and now we are we're like ninety percent.\n\nIn this last month, we've seen extreme results, and it's due to really refining things again and and making it better in twenty twenty four.\n\nMhmm. And in getting to a hundred k a month, do you feel like the m sourcery will be the main method, or do you feel like you will have to branch out to use other strategies?\n\nSo because we're now closing so many people and we're also closing them on our subscription base, I do believe we'll get to a hundred k or pretty close, probably about seventy, before we have to outsource.\n\nBut that will be, like, amazing. Like, when I my target is to have, about let's see. What do we say? To have without any other sales, just subscription every week, every week, because we do it even on a weekly basis to keep ourselves, like, tuning in and connecting with our clients. It's a good feedback loop weekly.\n\nIt's to do about fifteen thousand a week, like, just from that model only. Not including, like, just sales and other things that we do, but just from the subscription only. And so, like, without having this because we just launched this this full subscription model with more options. Like I said, we're gonna have ninety percent closing ratio now.\n\nWe just launched that at the beginning of of or about middle of February, twenty twenty four, the new version of this. And and that's where we then saw now ninety percent closes. We've reconnected with some even old clients again that couldn't do the twenty six thousand or big package. You know?\n\nAnd it's like, now they can because we have a subscription model that makes it more affordable that allows them to connect with us. So I am very, very confident that we'll probably hit seventy or eighty, with just DM Sourcery, and then we'll start to out source. But that will be a consistent. Right?\n\nThat's that's my excitement to you is that we're gonna see that through the When do you feel like you'll hit, like, seventy, eighty with the m sorter?\n\nHow how long are we talking?\n\nWell, we're probably on track to do about fifty five this month by the end of the month, and that's times flies. We're halfway through.\n\nAnd so I would say within the next probably two months, next two months, realistically, I would say in the next sixty days, we'll probably be at about seventy or eighty just because of the trajectory we're on now. It's gradual, gradual growth.\n\nSounds good.\n\nSo fifteen percent growth we anticipate every month.\n\nI mean, how does it feel to, you know, just have growth every single month you know is consistent? It's completely different from what you have previously.\n\nMan, it's awesome, bro. It's really awesome. Like, it really is. I am super duper grateful for the structure and systems that we have in place, and it really is a a a huge, huge, big thank you to the team over at Easy Grow because I know Charlie wouldn't take full credit for it.\n\nYou're you're part of that team. And I know there's some other owners too and stuff, but huge thank you because it feels really good to have some consistency. Again, I had to get out of my mind the lottery mentality of the big package and had to really focus on the more small bites over time and long term long term more of an investment mindset versus, hey. Let's get the results.\n\nBut we still get people results. That's the cool part. So, yeah, man. It it was a little rough after we got started with you guys.\n\nYou know, when you have a sixty thousand and twenty thousand and fifty thousand and then thirty thousand, those roller coasters are rough to be able to set things up now that we're at that consistent forty five and then fifty five.\n\nAnd it's just it's gonna be awesome. We can do a lot more, and we can we can really get a lot more focused knowing that we have a consistency now for sure. So thank you.\n\nThank you for paying.\n\nI guess, like, sort of the last question I've got for you, Carlos. If if if you looked back back in May, back to the call that we had, and you saw yourself in the call and, you know, you ended up coming on pause so you didn't need this. But if you're leaning towards not doing it, what would you have told yourself knowing what you know now?\n\nThere's a little bit of pressure me sitting here looking at you.\n\nOh, man. No. It's it's cool because I know once we once I, yeah, I think once I understood the process, it was a no brainer. Like and it was a missing link that we had, just that one process because it was used on me.\n\nSo it's a very good example.\n\nAnd I am hard to connect with. You and I know that because I I really I really I mean, I own a ranch as well. And so I've got a lot going on, other real estate investments and stuff. So this has been a beautiful journey.\n\nBut I would say to myself back then, it's like, man, freaking answer his messages. His response sooner, dude. This has missing piece. I would I would just say, dude, this is like because it I think it took us three or four months to really connect.\n\nThat's the beauty of of your persistence and and literally what Charlie has taught you guys as a team, but it's what he taught me as well. Not to take it personal.\n\nIt's so crazy. Recently, I realized we are in a battle for people's attention. That's really what it comes down to. That everyone is is getting notifications. It is a notification war.\n\nAnd when I realized that and and and Charlie and your team made me understand that. I don't take it personal anymore. I just freaking double up on the notifications, man. So they'll respond to me first. So it's crazy, but that's really what I've learned and the biggest revelation from working with you guys, a notification war. We're in war with all other social media platforms, so we just are learning to win at that, bro. So I wish I woulda had that.\n\nI would have got if somebody got a message from you guys, respond and book the appointment, book the strategy call the first time, not the tenth time or twelfth or thirteenth.\n\nBut, book it the first time because then, again, like, notifications aren't getting better. They're getting worse and worse and worse. So it is crazy to see that. And so back then, I would have even had more results, and I wouldn't have lost some of my clients to someone else who notified them more than I have.\n\nSo that's what I would say, bro. Do it sooner, Carlos. Do it sooner, man. Come on.\n\nWake up. Wake up. And and, man, you you you gave me the wake up call even to do this, bro. So thanks for your patience. Again, we went through it like, Carlos.\n\nAlright, man.\n\nYou're awesome, bro. Appreciate you.\n\nI appreciate you as well. We can probably call it there. It's been a pleasure.\n\nAnd, yeah, if everybody is wondering about booking a call, you can book a call. If not, no worries.\n\nAnd, yeah, if you need help with your marriage, you can take a call.\n\nSpare a quick call there.\n\nIf you want the best work with if you want epic marriage, you know how to call, man. Woo.\n\nIf not, it's cool. If you want mediocre, I understand.\n\nIn a flesh of man. Yeah. Let's probably wrap it up there. Cheers.\n\nCool. Blessings, bro. Thanks for doing this.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/wsf8ylf7w3?autoplay=0&wmode=transparent&wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

Hello, everybody. My name is Oscar. I work for Charlie Morgan at Imperium or Easy Garage, I should say.\n\nI just got finished with a client interview with a client of ours. His name is Carlos Campos. He's managed to scale his coaching business from twenty k to forty five k per month, literally in the span of ten months of working with us.\n\nLike, his main problem when he hopped on board, it was the two appointment setting, and now he's booking, like, over five appointments every single day, which is pretty awesome.\n\nSo, yeah, let's just hop into the client interview. It's an awesome one, and, yeah, I'll see you on the other side. Cheers.\n\nAlright, everybody. I am here with Carlos, who is a client of ours in EZUgo. Carlos, he came on board with us about what was that now? Like, ten months ago in May of last year twenty twenty three. And in that time period when you came on board, you're doing about, like, an average twenty k per month. And at this moment in time, you're averaging out at about forty five k per month, with the business.\n\nSo Carlos, if you can just, like, tell a little bit about yourself, like, what you're doing in the business and, yeah, just give a little bit of an introduction.\n\nSo, yeah, my name is Carlos Campos, and my gorgeous wife, Chantelle. She and I do marriage mastery.\n\nOur our movement is Epic Your Life Movement, of course, creating extraordinary.\n\nBut our niche is marriage mastery, and and so we work with we collaborate with, you know, people and and, influencers to create extraordinary.\n\nSo myself, my wife, our our specialty is in marriage and helping people to get married. Matter of fact, in the weeks next weekend, we'll be officiating a wedding that we help, two singles come together and get married through our process. But, also, we have, as you can see back here, couples that, that are already married, had kids, and we help them have epic marriages. So that's our niche as marriage mastery, bro.\n\nOkay. So it's essentially like you your coach when it comes to marriage. Like, what should I call it?\n\nYeah. Just a coach in marriage.\n\nYeah. I mean, we're an expert in in helping people to master the relationship of marriage, which is we have found is really beneficial on all levels.\n\nBut, really, it's through full immersion at our retreats because we host small retreats, small intimate retreats, and they're all inclusive. And then we also do mentorship where we support, and we we motivate and, help people to in their relationship skills. And then we also have, connection through a Mentor Connect app. And our our main thing that we help people with, it that we found three skills that they need to develop and we support them in developing this is confidence, communication, and commitment. It's our three c's of connection. That's that's what we do here, and that's what where where our results come from, for sure.\n\nFair. Fair. And so you came on board in about May last year. What was sort of like, when you're doing twenty k per month, what was sort of the main reason behind you coming on board and booking a call with us, like, back in May?\n\nYeah, man. When when I spoke to you, it's like, I just we're we need leads.\n\nWe need something because we have, like, we know we have a good product. We know we have good results. We literally, you know, had everything we needed. We felt like but we just we weren't getting the eyeballs. We weren't getting the attention, and you guys opened some doors for us that we hadn't been able to open before then.\n\nOkay. And when you say leads, is that is that essentially just, like, qualified appointments?\n\nTrue. Like, you know, we we weren't even doing very many as you call strategy calls or consultations with people to then evolve into a sale. Right? We weren't getting but one or two a week, and and we needed some kind of strategy or some kind of system because we're very good at following a system or a strategy, but we just couldn't find one that was working for us.\n\nAnd that could be easy and simple, and easy to apply and just follow directions. And, fortunately, we found you guys. Right? I'm so glad you you reached out to me, and you were persisting.\n\nYou used the very system on me that closed me.\n\nBut I used either did I still do the appointment setting back then?\n\nI'm not quite too sure. Who who sent you a message? Do you remember?\n\nWell, I thought it was you back then, wasn't it? Or maybe it was one of your assistants or maybe, actually, it was whoever it was, I think you closed me, if I remember right. Yeah.\n\nBut it was it was someone talking to me through, and It was supposed to be it was supposed to be a DM also a DM's like what we told you guys.\n\nRight?\n\nFor sure. Yeah. Okay. But through through what's his name's messaging, I don't know why it's saying Charlie.\n\nCharlie's Charlie Morgan's messenger. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nOkay. So you're saying, like, the main thing that was sort of sort of getting more leads. I mean, what did this business look like back then? You're saying, like, you needed more leads. What were you doing back then for for booking those appointments and getting those leads?\n\nYeah. That's literally organic and just referrals and trying to call clients and connect with them to get referrals and trying to do some things on Facebook, but not very successful, trying to do organic, get organic leads through Facebook Messenger and things like that. But we didn't have near the system when you guys had, but we kinda had an idea of that, but definitely not the strategy that you guys introduced us to. That made all the difference.\n\nOkay. And so you come on board.\n\nYep. You sort of you sort of, like, see the program in front of you. How how did you decide what to start picking?\n\nWell, I tell you, the low hanging fruit for us, when I went through it, Charlie's brilliant in the way he presents the content and the course, and a lot of it's mindset. And I did. I just stayed the course and went through it. But when I hit DM sorcery, that's where I stopped.\n\nBecause we had started doing some of that already, but we didn't do it with the the the the skill and strategy that you guys put together with that. It is really, really awesome. So that's really what caught us. And then, man, we went to work and implemented because it was low hanging fruit for us because we're already doing somewhat of that process, but definitely not the hybrid that you guys introduced us to.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo you started with the DM Sorcerer. Remember, if I'm not mistaken, you posted, like, a win in the community, like, within, I don't know how long, but you post, like, one of those very high ticket deals, didn't you? Like, within the get go.\n\nAbsolutely. And it was definitely through the DM sorcery because we were not yeah. We were doing, like, twenty k. And so then it bounced up to sixty k that first month, and we're just like, woah. They we're definitely on something for sure.\n\nMhmm. And what then happened, like, you have this system.\n\nI guess, like, at least one of the things that I'm hearing a lot is, like, what people want is they want predictable systems that they can turn on and off, and then they just know they get quality appointments booked.\n\nThe thing that then comes into place whether they can then deliver and whether they have to pause and start and pause and start. Right? That's been a whole lot of thing. But do you feel like you've gotten that system that you can pause and start and then you just know they're gonna come in, or how does that look?\n\nSo there's definitely been that. Right? Getting the whole because then there's fulfillment. And that's why I've noticed, like, it's for us, it was a cycle.\n\nLike, we would have a big month, like, sixty thousand. It's like, oh, dang. We gotta do fulfillment because they're big packages. Right?\n\nSo as we have, developed our team and really created a better system, now we're getting that consistency, consistency, consistency. And instead of having, like, a sixty thousand dollar a month and then a twenty thousand dollar a month, which is I mean, it's common in business, but now we're really, really seeing the consistency of about forty five k a month, which we're super pumped about. And it's no longer this this surge. Again, because we've implemented the DM sorcery and got the consistency of that and then also the fulfillment side of it as well because that was a struggle, to be honest.\n\nLike, the the fulfillment was like, oh, crap. Okay. Now we gotta do the fulfillment on these big packages with our clients, and it's a lot of commitment on our part, like, to to fulfill. It's there's a reason it's a big package.\n\nAnd so that was the thing was like, okay. We have the same flex of cash flow, but now we've really dialed in the subscription model on a smaller basis, but more every month, every month, every month, and it's paid off big time. So that's what we're super pumped about is is having that forty five k, but having it in staying, not the fluctuation. Like, we averaged forty five, but there was a lot of fluctuation.\n\nWhere now it's just this consistent rise, man. Like, ten to fifteen to twenty percent every month, and we're building off of it, which I'm super grateful. And all literally, we still just use focused on Tim's for three. That may not be what people wanna hear sometimes because but that's I I I have to give kudos to what you guys have done with Easy Grow and Charlie. Seriously, Charlie Morgan is an an amazing The team you guys have there in developing this because just with one, we've been able to create that kind of income. We know if we start implementing all these other ones, or working with people that do the better at this because we again, our niche, that's what we realized too is we wanna focus on what we do in our marriage mastery instead of being a lead generator. But we have been able to do that just through our d m sour DM sorcery and still not outsourcing anything yet.\n\nBut that Okay. Through the plan Yes.\n\nSo you haven't even outsourced anything, especially just you and your wife still doing the.\n\nNo. I'm saying outsourcing as far as hiring any kind of lead generation company or working with anybody else to do our marketing or ads. We're still just you our DM sorcery in house and and applying what you taught us to get it to the the stability and the consistent growth now.\n\nOkay. And when you're talking about sort of, like, you only haven't used one of the strategies, are you planning to hop into some of the paid app strategies or some of the other strategies we've got in the future? What does the future hold?\n\nWell, you know, we've been looking at them.\n\nBut I don't want see, this is where then I I I struggle with, and your group and your team there at Easy Grow does provide ways to outsource it because I'm really good at what I do with the relationships.\n\nSo we've worked on the DM Sourcery, and it fits for what we do in relationships and and connect with our clients and old clients, existing clients, and then new clients. We it's all appropriate using DM Sourcery. When it comes into the ads and creating the and doing that stuff, we have we're kind of dabbling in it, seeing if we wanna do it, but we realized, like, we're probably gonna have to have someone committed just to that to start implementing your other stuff. Does that make sense?\n\nOkay. I get you.\n\nSo, like, the main thing you've used is DM source, and you also talked a little bit about the mindset. I guess, like, from you having gone through some of the parts of the program, what do you feel like was the most valuable thing to you? It could be DMs also. It could be mindset. It could be a third thing. What what do you feel was, like, most bang for the buck?\n\nI mean and the support of the community. There's no doubt. Like, it's incredible support, like, the feed there, and I can always jump on there and do a search and find the information that I need. And people are asking similar questions that I have.\n\nThere's answers there. There's really good, like, support through the community and through people like you. Oscar, you guys are always attentive to to answer questions and connect with us. It's really powerful to have that kind of support, through the community.\n\nBut, also, yes, DM Sorcher, I'd have to say, one thing about what what he did, the the the mindset thing about going through the fire, like, that was really in the pain. That is one thing that I will tell you was a new perspective that I've never ever heard from someone, and I really have applied it to my own life and to with our clients actually of expressing how important pain is and recognizing the way that, you know, he talks about pain in the mindset stuff and that it's essential for growth and development was really a cool perspective.\n\nAnd that was, like, my big takeaway for the mindset stuff because I've been through a lot of that, but that was one thing that really uniquely stood out to me. And then number two, definitely the DM sorcery and the system and strategy that was absolutely laid out brilliantly. You just gotta follow the steps and do it. And then even just to tell you too, even refining our messaging because I love and appreciate that.\n\nLike, we had done that. We had set up our avatar and those things. However, it was really good to go back through it through this system, and make it better. And I continue to actually do that, use, you know, a lot of the the strategies that Charlie talks about to refine your avatar, refine your business and what you do and who you serve and all those things and how you do it.\n\nLike, it's all really well laid out there and which helps in your messaging for marketing. So we've definitely refined that in the last since June and I since I got started with you guys, I've definitely used that multiple times to continue and improve our messaging and our and our our because that's part of it. Like, DM Sorcery is great, but our refinement or messaging has come through this process with Charlie of the of that refinement, right, and understanding your market and continuing to use that, like, has really made a huge difference to where now we're getting even better results and more people responding to DM sorcery because we we have refined our message and made it better and simpler, simpler, simpler, simpler, like, you know, just like marriage mastery.\n\nThat's what we refined it down to.\n\nYou know, when when Epic Your Life is our movement, but what we do in our niche is is creating is marriage mastery and creating epic marriages if you wanna use that. So it's really helped a lot, and I'm super grateful because that was a big part of it too as well and to see our success and continued success. Because one thing to have flash in the pan, it's another thing to maintain it and keep it going, and that's what we've been able to do.\n\nYeah. I guess, like, that's the main thing for you. Like, you've been able to hit more consistency. Like, I lost more consistency as you said. So, like, now you're doing forty five k per month. What's the plan moving forward? We've talked about a hundred k a month before, but, I mean, like, what what does the future look like?\n\nI mean, it's more real than ever now because what we're doing is more sustainable.\n\nWe're finding out that, again, the bigger packages take a little bit more trust and time. We admittedly, we sold those to people that had been ex as we did our research, they've been exposed to us for a couple years, right, and and and plugging in. So we knew there was that's where we built the trust. So it's real.\n\nLike, I'm not saying we can't sell it, but now we're almost when we were we know our numbers. Like, on our big packages, we were selling about twenty four, twenty five percent. You'd be like, wow. Just get more leads.\n\nI agree. However, like, the more leads we got, that percentage kept going down and down because it's such a high package.\n\nThat's still good. We could still get more leads, and that'd be great. But now now that we've refined our message and we've we've developed our packages and have more options for our clientele all around marriage mastery, we actually are, like, ninety percent closing ratio because we have something for everyone. And as, you know, I know, Charlie says and so does, you know, Alex or Mosey, there's a reason why they got on the call with you.\n\nThey want to do something. Otherwise, they wouldn't have got on the call with you. So that's what we've really been able to do is perfect the messaging and even perfect our packaging thanks to what Charlie's helped us with for sure in that mindset and that process. And and now we are we're like ninety percent.\n\nIn this last month, we've seen extreme results, and it's due to really refining things again and and making it better in twenty twenty four.\n\nMhmm. And in getting to a hundred k a month, do you feel like the m sourcery will be the main method, or do you feel like you will have to branch out to use other strategies?\n\nSo because we're now closing so many people and we're also closing them on our subscription base, I do believe we'll get to a hundred k or pretty close, probably about seventy, before we have to outsource.\n\nBut that will be, like, amazing. Like, when I my target is to have, about let's see. What do we say? To have without any other sales, just subscription every week, every week, because we do it even on a weekly basis to keep ourselves, like, tuning in and connecting with our clients. It's a good feedback loop weekly.\n\nIt's to do about fifteen thousand a week, like, just from that model only. Not including, like, just sales and other things that we do, but just from the subscription only. And so, like, without having this because we just launched this this full subscription model with more options. Like I said, we're gonna have ninety percent closing ratio now.\n\nWe just launched that at the beginning of of or about middle of February, twenty twenty four, the new version of this. And and that's where we then saw now ninety percent closes. We've reconnected with some even old clients again that couldn't do the twenty six thousand or big package. You know?\n\nAnd it's like, now they can because we have a subscription model that makes it more affordable that allows them to connect with us. So I am very, very confident that we'll probably hit seventy or eighty, with just DM Sourcery, and then we'll start to out source. But that will be a consistent. Right?\n\nThat's that's my excitement to you is that we're gonna see that through the When do you feel like you'll hit, like, seventy, eighty with the m sorter?\n\nHow how long are we talking?\n\nWell, we're probably on track to do about fifty five this month by the end of the month, and that's times flies. We're halfway through.\n\nAnd so I would say within the next probably two months, next two months, realistically, I would say in the next sixty days, we'll probably be at about seventy or eighty just because of the trajectory we're on now. It's gradual, gradual growth.\n\nSounds good.\n\nSo fifteen percent growth we anticipate every month.\n\nI mean, how does it feel to, you know, just have growth every single month you know is consistent? It's completely different from what you have previously.\n\nMan, it's awesome, bro. It's really awesome. Like, it really is. I am super duper grateful for the structure and systems that we have in place, and it really is a a a huge, huge, big thank you to the team over at Easy Grow because I know Charlie wouldn't take full credit for it.\n\nYou're you're part of that team. And I know there's some other owners too and stuff, but huge thank you because it feels really good to have some consistency. Again, I had to get out of my mind the lottery mentality of the big package and had to really focus on the more small bites over time and long term long term more of an investment mindset versus, hey. Let's get the results.\n\nBut we still get people results. That's the cool part. So, yeah, man. It it was a little rough after we got started with you guys.\n\nYou know, when you have a sixty thousand and twenty thousand and fifty thousand and then thirty thousand, those roller coasters are rough to be able to set things up now that we're at that consistent forty five and then fifty five.\n\nAnd it's just it's gonna be awesome. We can do a lot more, and we can we can really get a lot more focused knowing that we have a consistency now for sure. So thank you.\n\nThank you for paying.\n\nI guess, like, sort of the last question I've got for you, Carlos. If if if you looked back back in May, back to the call that we had, and you saw yourself in the call and, you know, you ended up coming on pause so you didn't need this. But if you're leaning towards not doing it, what would you have told yourself knowing what you know now?\n\nThere's a little bit of pressure me sitting here looking at you.\n\nOh, man. No. It's it's cool because I know once we once I, yeah, I think once I understood the process, it was a no brainer. Like and it was a missing link that we had, just that one process because it was used on me.\n\nSo it's a very good example.\n\nAnd I am hard to connect with. You and I know that because I I really I really I mean, I own a ranch as well. And so I've got a lot going on, other real estate investments and stuff. So this has been a beautiful journey.\n\nBut I would say to myself back then, it's like, man, freaking answer his messages. His response sooner, dude. This has missing piece. I would I would just say, dude, this is like because it I think it took us three or four months to really connect.\n\nThat's the beauty of of your persistence and and literally what Charlie has taught you guys as a team, but it's what he taught me as well. Not to take it personal.\n\nIt's so crazy. Recently, I realized we are in a battle for people's attention. That's really what it comes down to. That everyone is is getting notifications. It is a notification war.\n\nAnd when I realized that and and and Charlie and your team made me understand that. I don't take it personal anymore. I just freaking double up on the notifications, man. So they'll respond to me first. So it's crazy, but that's really what I've learned and the biggest revelation from working with you guys, a notification war. We're in war with all other social media platforms, so we just are learning to win at that, bro. So I wish I woulda had that.\n\nI would have got if somebody got a message from you guys, respond and book the appointment, book the strategy call the first time, not the tenth time or twelfth or thirteenth.\n\nBut, book it the first time because then, again, like, notifications aren't getting better. They're getting worse and worse and worse. So it is crazy to see that. And so back then, I would have even had more results, and I wouldn't have lost some of my clients to someone else who notified them more than I have.\n\nSo that's what I would say, bro. Do it sooner, Carlos. Do it sooner, man. Come on.\n\nWake up. Wake up. And and, man, you you you gave me the wake up call even to do this, bro. So thanks for your patience. Again, we went through it like, Carlos.\n\nAlright, man.\n\nYou're awesome, bro. Appreciate you.\n\nI appreciate you as well. We can probably call it there. It's been a pleasure.\n\nAnd, yeah, if everybody is wondering about booking a call, you can book a call. If not, no worries.\n\nAnd, yeah, if you need help with your marriage, you can take a call.\n\nSpare a quick call there.\n\nIf you want the best work with if you want epic marriage, you know how to call, man. Woo.\n\nIf not, it's cool. If you want mediocre, I understand.\n\nIn a flesh of man. Yeah. Let's probably wrap it up there. Cheers.\n\nCool. Blessings, bro. Thanks for doing this."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}}, {});
