Yeah. Let's do it.\n\nBeautiful. Cameron, England. How is it going, brother?\n\nI guess before we, I guess, before we dive into anything, perhaps it would be it would be useful, it would be prudent for you to just give a little brief in that introduction as to who you are, what you do with your business, who you serve, and obviously, what your current monthly reoccurring revenue is.\n\nMhmm. Yeah. So my name is Cameron England. Started in the agency space same November of around twenty twenty two or so. So I've been in there for around a year and four months, something along those lines.\n\nFrom that point, that I called calling, put in the reps, dropped out of high school at the time when I was sixteen. And then fast forward to now eighteen, we've got an agency that had a top line month of around ninety, ninety five thousand dollars. And at present, we're doing about fifty to sixty k recurring cash flow, not taking into consideration moving cash.\n\nBeautiful, bro.\n\nI'm very excited to dive into your into your story because I know that, you know, out of a lot of the clients that we've had on board, you're one of those people that has worked incessantly to be able to, get the level of progress that you've you've managed to reach. Also, again, the fact that you're so young is is very impressive. But let's let's take this all the way back. Let's take this back to November of twenty twenty two.\n\nInitially, what put you on the path of wanting to get into digital marketing?\n\nI think it was honestly, initially came down to always feeling like I was below other people. Like, not even just financially, but personally as well. Just that that obsession with self improvement and wanting to get better with myself. And then it just gets more and more addicting.\n\nYou wanna make more and more money, but that's a different story in itself. Right? But I feel like the biggest thing for me was just wanting an out of a nine to five. I always thought I was very I was always labeled as, like, bossy, and I wanted to kinda, like, lead the show in a sense.\n\nAnd I I don't think I would have been able to do that going down the traditional route. And then you see Andrew saying, you see all these gurus, and then that's what kind of planted the seed in my mind to start looking into stuff like this.\n\nOkay. Interesting. So at that point in time, you said that you were still in high school, still in sixth form, I'm guessing.\n\nYeah.\n\nWhat was the plan at that point in time before you'd dived into digital marketing? Had you run any other businesses before this? Have you tried drop shipping, anything like that?\n\nYeah. So when I was in I was in college, I got an apprenticeship when I was coming out of secondary school.\n\nTurned it down because I just didn't wanna do it. So that was the plan initially. You know, the whole family thought I was set. I was gonna make forty k after, like, five years. It would have been safe, and I didn't really wanna do it. So I went to college, went there three days a week. The first business I had was actually in secondary school where if you want a class, it is a business, which was selling vapes in the toilets and in my local area.\n\nYeah. So that actually did pretty well. We had, like, fifty percent profit margin per vape, and I'd sell a lot of them. You know? Mhmm. But, of course, that isn't sustainable. And then I actually went in Andrew Tate's office university.\n\nOkay.\n\nStarted learning about copywriting and things like that. And I think that was a turning point for me because not necessarily the skills that I learned, but more so the fact that it was like a slap in the face to say, this shit's a lot harder than it's made out to me. I think it uninformed optimism is what you have when you initially start. Right? You think everything's gonna be a lot easier than it is. You know, you sign some clients on a two k retainer.\n\nWell, that made me realize that's not the case, and I think that was the best thing that coulda happened.\n\nOkay. That's very, very interesting. So first and foremost, this entrepreneurial spirit has always been within you. You've always wanted to, kind of walk your own path.\n\nBut then the fact that, obviously, you dived into, I believe, the real world, and been were able to probably get a little bit of exposure toward the possibilities out there. Okay. So that's interesting. So that takes us a little bit further down the line.\n\nWhen was it that you you discovered Charlie? Was that a little bit later? Was that earlier? How did that come to pass?\n\nI think it was around maybe early twenty twenty three. I think maybe just summertime, actually, around March, April time. Funny enough, my first point of contact with Charlie is I was watching a lot of his videos, And then initially, it was with that sales thing where I was initially offered to to come on the team and be a sales rep. Right?\n\nAnd at the time, I was like, do I do it? Do I not? And I stuck to what my gut was telling me, and I was like, no. You just gotta keep doing what you're doing.\n\nYou know?\n\nYeah. I remember this because I was in Turkey at the time. This is when I was living the digital nomad lifestyle. And Charlie was like, I've got this guy who I feel like might be, good for the sales team. And I had we had a pretty long conversation.\n\nAnd I I could tell myself, I was like, I'm not sure that I was like, I'm not sure he's gonna be the best fit for the team because it seems like he really wants to to do his own thing. So even at that stage, because you were you were posting a lot of videos on YouTube. You were even from the jump, like, you were really trying to establish a personal brand. Like, you're very similar to Iman in the sense that pretty much your whole story is out there from from day one.\n\nHow did you find those initial stages when you were trying to figure out positioning in the market? How to structure your offer? How to actually conduct call calls. How how was that at the beginning?\n\nIt was kinda like being in a major the blindfold on this. Like, you take you're taking the next step with hopes that you're gonna land on the right step, and you're not gonna fall back down again. You have really no sense of direction, no sense of what what what the hell am I gonna do to get to the next level because you hear about these things and signing retainers and scaling up and hitting a hundred k, and it gets so glorified. But getting there is a different story because there's so much work that goes into it in the day to day, and it just compounds those small micro actions.\n\nAnd it was just figuring it out each day, messing up, figuring things out, and just pushing forward, but certainly took a lot. I would say when it started, it took a lot longer than I anticipated. Again, I started with that uninformed optimism. Mhmm.\n\nAnd then the the popcorn effect really started to take off, say, summertime, Well, all of a sudden, I feel like as a result of all the work I put in at the start of the year, on the rare end of twenty twenty two Mhmm.\n\nAs a lagging lagging indicator, things started performing. The business started growing, and that's when, I guess, things started picking up. But at the start, yeah, it was tough. I didn't really know anything, so I was just figuring it out. You know?\n\nOkay. So the at that stage, was it literally trial and error?\n\nYou would Yeah.\n\nWow. That's that's insane. And it's it's very interesting that you went through that pathway because you didn't even look for help. I think it as you said, it was we came to you, which is very unusual.\n\nI think it's probably one of the only people that we have reached out to, on that side of things. Okay. Beautiful. So when that initial conversation happened, Charlie reached out to you.\n\nI remember him telling me he liked you because you you just seemed very confident on the sales calls. Right?\n\nNot on the sales calls, on the on the cold calls that you were taking. Yeah. At that stage, had you managed to to sign on some clients as of yet?\n\nI think I had a couple here and there. Initially, my first I think it was my first five clients I signed through cold calls, d cold outbound DMs on Instagram, Facebook.\n\nBut I was labeling them as closes, but it was really just me being a glorified freelancer doing absolutely everything and just getting paid a commission of everybody that I booked in. So it was, like, fifty pound per appointment I was booking in. And I had, like, five of them, and it was good, but it was hard because then I was trying to market the business, dial, take sales call, build a good product, hire a team. And at the same time, I was calling my clients' leads, like, twelve hours a day.\n\nSo it was all compounded into one thing. I wouldn't label it as me having the proper clients. I'd say I was a glorified freelancer getting paid a decent amount a month for it. Yeah.\n\nOkay. Cool. And at that stage, do you remember how many hours you were putting into actually doing the work on a on a daily basis when you were in that glorified freelancer stage?\n\nIt must have been a I I don't remember a day where I haven't worked, so I was, like, year and a half. There's not really been a day where I've took a day off.\n\nAnd it's not out of, like it's not because I didn't it's not because I don't want to. It's just I just enjoy what I do. You know? So I just wanna work in it. But I then it was probably, like, sixteen hours, something like that. Jesus Christ.\n\nOkay. Cool. Well, I guess that kind of brings us to the point where you dive into the product.\n\nMhmm.\n\nI think you must have probably jumped into the product around March, so it would have been a year ago, around this time a year ago. What what were your initial thoughts on the product? How did it help with all of these problems that you are facing, those sixteen hour days that you were doing at the time? How did it help you to streamline things?\n\nI would say the biggest thing was going through the self transcendence portion, which I actually went back to in January because I didn't get chance to finish it all because there's just so much to go through. It's absolutely insane.\n\nAnd I went back to it, and it get it just got better the second time I went through it. Because I know everybody talks about the strategy, but I I truly think that a lot of the strategy is already out there.\n\nMhmm.\n\nIt's it's what you do with that information. And if you're willing to go through what it takes to to get the outcome that you want, like, in order to get what you want, you have to deserve what you want. Right?\n\nI think a big piece of that is, like, the the self transcendence as it's labeled. Becoming somebody worthy of the business that you wanna own, of the body that you wanna have.\n\nGoing through that was a game changer, and it kind of confused me a lot, but it was it was that's what was the turning point for me, going through that.\n\nOkay. And when you say that it was the turning point for you, what kind of shift started happening for you in terms of your parent times, in terms of your limiting beliefs?\n\nOne big thing was just realizing that goals are there, not necessarily goals should be hygiene standards, and that was a big shift for me. Rather than setting these goals of a hundred k a month and things like that, it's not a hundred k a month is the eventual goal in maybe five years.\n\nIt's a hundred k a month is the hygiene standard. If I am not making a hundred thousand dollars a month coming into my bank, I feel disgusted.\n\nJust something so simple like that and going through the oscillations of the life cycles and building out what my life needs to look like in order to become somebody deserving of a business that makes that amount of money and reading it every single morning. Because because I was one of those that got so tied up in, like, yeah, the sixteen hour days.\n\nIt's like riding getting on a boat with no sense of direction.\n\nLike, you just get so tied up in all the chaos and the bullshit and the to dos and the Slack notifications, but I was never zooming out and looking, okay. This is the big picture. This is where we need to stare the shit. This is where we're aiming towards. Right? And I think that was a big game changer. Setting hygiene standards, having a clear cut understanding as to where the shit was headed and how to get it there.\n\nOkay. So at that point, you feel like you've got a little bit more direction, and it's conceptually a lot easier for you to understand how you are actually going to become the person that you are now. Right?\n\nBeyond that point, what were the the things that you gained from the product that really helped you to simplify the chaos that was that was going on at that point in time, like the sixteen hour days? How did you slowly start transitioning away from that and getting back into the position where you're working on the business instead of necessarily in it?\n\nUh-huh.\n\nRealizing that I didn't need to do everything and going through the hiring portion was a big part as well.\n\nI was always so initially, I didn't really know how to hire, of course, because I've never done it before. So I'd I'd pay somebody, like, one k each time I wanted wanted to hire a Filipino VA to place them, and then I'd be paying them, like, a twenty percent commission or, like, a twenty percent additional fee month to month.\n\nAnd I did that for, like, the first six people behind.\n\nIt was a mess.\n\nOh my oh my god, Cameron.\n\nYeah. Yeah. That was kinda stupid until I realized how easy it really was. Mhmm. If you have the right qualification forms in place, if you're running the right ads, if you're on the right job platforms, things like that.\n\nAnd just looking at every single task through a lens of, is this something that I can automate, delegate, eliminate? Is this worth my cost per hour? Like, really zooming out and going, okay. The business is making twenty k right now.\n\nI'm working ten hours a day. That means my time's worth, for example, two hundred dollars an hour. Is updating a client's ad worth two hundred dollars an hour, or can I get somebody for five dollars an hour to refresh that creative? And just delegating those pieces and focusing on the only two things that actually move the money you need, which is mainly sales and marketing.\n\nAnd then everything else can mostly be delegated besides, of course, monitoring, working on, building a strong team culture, building a solid team.\n\nSo, yeah, that was the biggest thing that got me to go from working on in the business, feeling like I needed to keep tight to my money the whole time and not hire anybody and keep margins as as big as possible to then working on it, delegate and automate and then eliminating everything.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo you basically as much as possible.\n\nYou basically did a a complete one eighty. You, you probably got to that point right where because you've been putting in so much time doing sixteen hours that you were so sick of it that it was a case of, like, I need to get this off my hands as quickly as possible. Okay. That's interesting.\n\nIn terms of, like, the community, in terms of using the support mechanisms, were you super active with that, or was it more just a case of you had your head down, you were happy cracking on by yourself, you knew what you needed to do at this stage because you had a step by step process?\n\nYeah. To be honest, I didn't really use this community and support too much, but every time I have, it's been helpful. Like, I looked in the classroom the other day because I haven't really been on many of the calls. I was like, holy shit.\n\nWhy is it so many calls? No. I said, oh, no. It's weird. I was like, okay.\n\nFair. So now every time I jump into school, at least I know I can jump in a call. Like, the, one of them was extra helpful was the performance coaching. So I jumped on that a couple of times with Billy.\n\nThat was good in terms of optimizing health. For me, it was never a case of I didn't know what to do. Mhmm. I think it was just a case of just doing it without pain avoidance because I made the mistake before with other coaching programs and other systems that I've put in place. Like, putting so much time into, like, information overload even though I already knew what I needed to do. So I just wanted to put my head down and focus on the thing that I needed to do. You know?\n\nOkay. That makes sense. Another thing that I I kind of wanna touch on is, obviously, we did a we did a mastermind back in October, and you you came through to that with a couple of the other guys.\n\nWhat was that experience like being at a mastermind?\n\nWas that your first mastermind that you'd been to having It was.\n\nOkay.\n\nYeah. That was in I'll be honest. That was really good.\n\nAnd what would you say fucking good.\n\nWhat what would you say were the the key takeaways that that you got from that three day event?\n\nBecause it like, I've considered going to Masterminds. Funny enough, I've been to, like, two or three others now purely because I just loved it so much. I just wanted to be in rooms like that again and again and again.\n\nIt's gonna sound cliche, but, again, the the connections, the networking, being around people that sit next to you, and they're just like, yeah. I'll just make, like, five hundred k. It's just five hundred k a month. It's just nothing.\n\nLike, it completely breaks your mental barrier. Like, you see somebody on Zoom, it's a little bit different in a group setting. You see they're sat next to you on a table and you realize, this guy is just normal. Right?\n\nHe's just a normal geezer. You know?\n\nThat's what really shifted my mind. And at the same time, like, again, all of the mindset stuff we went over, all of the strategy, the connections. I still speak to a handful of the people that I met at that event on a week to week basis. We meet you up every now and again. So just those connections, like lifelong friends that will come from events like that is is incredible too.\n\nAnd this is this is one thing that I I as I've said this so many times in client interviews, but one thing that I think is so understated about just getting in a product of some sort, especially when you've got quality people in there, it is that network effect. It is that hygiene standard just immediately gets raised because you're surrounded by a different caliber of people, and it changes your perspective on what is normal and what you can accomplish. So that's that's fantastic.\n\nOkay. Well, Cameron, I guess to to push this more towards the direction of of people who might be sitting on the fence.\n\nFor somebody who's, you know, watching this interview, watching some of the other client interviews, maybe has jumped on a call with me, jumped on a call with some of the other guys, and they're not sure whether or not this is actually gonna help them, What is it that you would say to someone who's who's in that position at the moment?\n\nI've been in that position, and the scariest thing to to be in the scariest position to be in is in that paralysis period where you do I do it? Do I not? Honestly, worst case scenario, you spend some money and maybe you don't like it. But the the way I see it is you either pay with time or you pay with money. Like, regardless of if you need things right now. Like, honestly, when I came into the program, I didn't need anything.\n\nIt wasn't a need.\n\nHowever, I knew damn right it would elevate or accelerate my progression because I would be around other people. I would make connections because you are who you surround yourself with as well. And if you don't have that caliber of person in your environment on the day to day, which I don't because I'm in the middle of nowhere, you need that.\n\nYep.\n\nAnd that's the biggest thing for me. Just the community, the coaching. Like, I would be happy to pay for a program just for the networking piece alone because I knew know that it will make me more money as a byproduct of me just being around better people.\n\nBeautiful. Yeah. I agree with you on that front. Okay. Last last two questions then. First one, Cameron, what is the goal, brother?\n\nWhat is the goal for twenty twenty four? Where do you wanna take the business?\n\nWhat are you looking to do?\n\nMhmm.\n\nYeah. So the goal for twenty twenty four in the business is one point six million revenue, so they're eight percent sure. And that's the goal top line revenue.\n\nWe want two hundred and fifty active clients under management, thirty five percent margin.\n\nAnd then, eventually, in the next twelve to thirty six months, sell cash out for, like, a rate to four x multiple, and then, I don't know, figure figure things out from there. But that that's the goal that I'm focused on right now.\n\nK. Beautiful. Last thing, Cameron, is there anything that you want to to share? I think, to be honest with you, especially given your age, and you've seen this.\n\nI've seen this myself. Especially because of people like Andrew Tate. We've got people like Charlie. There's a ton of very influential guys out there right now who are really speaking to your generation and really showing them a different path that they can they can walk.\n\nYou being that guy, right, eighteen years old, making a hundred k on a monthly basis, what is it that you would say to, you know, some of the peers that you might have at school who are thinking about the fact that they're gonna be stuck in a nine to five x, y, and z? What is something that you can share with them to kind of push them in a better direction?\n\nJust zoom out.\n\nI know it sounds cliche, but just zoom out and think, like, do you, and you've probably heard it before, but you really wanna die.\n\nLike, you don't live for long. Like, you live a very, very short period of time. Nothing really matters.\n\nNonetheless, I just think it's important to do something that's true to you. You know? Because otherwise, then you're gonna die, and you're gonna be pretty depressed for the whole of your life.\n\nFor me, anyway, again, I know some people are different, but Mhmm. I just wouldn't I wouldn't wanna live as somebody else internally as I felt as I acted externally. Like, they've gotta be in sync with one another. If you feel internally that a nine to five isn't for you and you wanna become a leader and you wanna do good, cool shit and live a good life and have a mission and a purpose, then if you don't express that externally, you're always gonna be out of sync and you're never gonna have peace of mind.\n\nAnd I think a lot of people know that, but how do they overcome that fear of actually taking the the steps, having the confidence to become that person?\n\nI think the confidence comes as a byproduct of taking the leap even though you don't know where it's gonna get you. I don't think you just build the confidence out of the gate. Because I'm still building it now, and it all comes with microaction on a macro scale compounds. And those actions then have people label you over a period of time as confident or disciplined.\n\nYeah. I really agree with that. And this is something that I say to a lot of people in the sales calls. You know, when someone jumps on the call and they're like, they're similarly to your age and they say, look. I wanna get to ten k, twenty k, thirty k, whatever it might be. And then they're fearful to take that step forwards As best as I can, I try to explain them that that threshold of overcoming the fear is integral to the process of getting to your goal? And if you can't do it, you're not gonna make it.\n\nBut, anyway, Cameron, brother, I really appreciate it. I appreciate the time. I'm excited to see what you do with the rest of this year. And, yeah, brother. I wish you the best of luck.\n\nYeah. Appreciate it.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/wgy1ja52li?autoplay=0&wmode=transparent&wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

Yeah. Let's do it.\n\nBeautiful. Cameron, England. How is it going, brother?\n\nI guess before we, I guess, before we dive into anything, perhaps it would be it would be useful, it would be prudent for you to just give a little brief in that introduction as to who you are, what you do with your business, who you serve, and obviously, what your current monthly reoccurring revenue is.\n\nMhmm. Yeah. So my name is Cameron England. Started in the agency space same November of around twenty twenty two or so. So I've been in there for around a year and four months, something along those lines.\n\nFrom that point, that I called calling, put in the reps, dropped out of high school at the time when I was sixteen. And then fast forward to now eighteen, we've got an agency that had a top line month of around ninety, ninety five thousand dollars. And at present, we're doing about fifty to sixty k recurring cash flow, not taking into consideration moving cash.\n\nBeautiful, bro.\n\nI'm very excited to dive into your into your story because I know that, you know, out of a lot of the clients that we've had on board, you're one of those people that has worked incessantly to be able to, get the level of progress that you've you've managed to reach. Also, again, the fact that you're so young is is very impressive. But let's let's take this all the way back. Let's take this back to November of twenty twenty two.\n\nInitially, what put you on the path of wanting to get into digital marketing?\n\nI think it was honestly, initially came down to always feeling like I was below other people. Like, not even just financially, but personally as well. Just that that obsession with self improvement and wanting to get better with myself. And then it just gets more and more addicting.\n\nYou wanna make more and more money, but that's a different story in itself. Right? But I feel like the biggest thing for me was just wanting an out of a nine to five. I always thought I was very I was always labeled as, like, bossy, and I wanted to kinda, like, lead the show in a sense.\n\nAnd I I don't think I would have been able to do that going down the traditional route. And then you see Andrew saying, you see all these gurus, and then that's what kind of planted the seed in my mind to start looking into stuff like this.\n\nOkay. Interesting. So at that point in time, you said that you were still in high school, still in sixth form, I'm guessing.\n\nYeah.\n\nWhat was the plan at that point in time before you'd dived into digital marketing? Had you run any other businesses before this? Have you tried drop shipping, anything like that?\n\nYeah. So when I was in I was in college, I got an apprenticeship when I was coming out of secondary school.\n\nTurned it down because I just didn't wanna do it. So that was the plan initially. You know, the whole family thought I was set. I was gonna make forty k after, like, five years. It would have been safe, and I didn't really wanna do it. So I went to college, went there three days a week. The first business I had was actually in secondary school where if you want a class, it is a business, which was selling vapes in the toilets and in my local area.\n\nYeah. So that actually did pretty well. We had, like, fifty percent profit margin per vape, and I'd sell a lot of them. You know? Mhmm. But, of course, that isn't sustainable. And then I actually went in Andrew Tate's office university.\n\nOkay.\n\nStarted learning about copywriting and things like that. And I think that was a turning point for me because not necessarily the skills that I learned, but more so the fact that it was like a slap in the face to say, this shit's a lot harder than it's made out to me. I think it uninformed optimism is what you have when you initially start. Right? You think everything's gonna be a lot easier than it is. You know, you sign some clients on a two k retainer.\n\nWell, that made me realize that's not the case, and I think that was the best thing that coulda happened.\n\nOkay. That's very, very interesting. So first and foremost, this entrepreneurial spirit has always been within you. You've always wanted to, kind of walk your own path.\n\nBut then the fact that, obviously, you dived into, I believe, the real world, and been were able to probably get a little bit of exposure toward the possibilities out there. Okay. So that's interesting. So that takes us a little bit further down the line.\n\nWhen was it that you you discovered Charlie? Was that a little bit later? Was that earlier? How did that come to pass?\n\nI think it was around maybe early twenty twenty three. I think maybe just summertime, actually, around March, April time. Funny enough, my first point of contact with Charlie is I was watching a lot of his videos, And then initially, it was with that sales thing where I was initially offered to to come on the team and be a sales rep. Right?\n\nAnd at the time, I was like, do I do it? Do I not? And I stuck to what my gut was telling me, and I was like, no. You just gotta keep doing what you're doing.\n\nYou know?\n\nYeah. I remember this because I was in Turkey at the time. This is when I was living the digital nomad lifestyle. And Charlie was like, I've got this guy who I feel like might be, good for the sales team. And I had we had a pretty long conversation.\n\nAnd I I could tell myself, I was like, I'm not sure that I was like, I'm not sure he's gonna be the best fit for the team because it seems like he really wants to to do his own thing. So even at that stage, because you were you were posting a lot of videos on YouTube. You were even from the jump, like, you were really trying to establish a personal brand. Like, you're very similar to Iman in the sense that pretty much your whole story is out there from from day one.\n\nHow did you find those initial stages when you were trying to figure out positioning in the market? How to structure your offer? How to actually conduct call calls. How how was that at the beginning?\n\nIt was kinda like being in a major the blindfold on this. Like, you take you're taking the next step with hopes that you're gonna land on the right step, and you're not gonna fall back down again. You have really no sense of direction, no sense of what what what the hell am I gonna do to get to the next level because you hear about these things and signing retainers and scaling up and hitting a hundred k, and it gets so glorified. But getting there is a different story because there's so much work that goes into it in the day to day, and it just compounds those small micro actions.\n\nAnd it was just figuring it out each day, messing up, figuring things out, and just pushing forward, but certainly took a lot. I would say when it started, it took a lot longer than I anticipated. Again, I started with that uninformed optimism. Mhmm.\n\nAnd then the the popcorn effect really started to take off, say, summertime, Well, all of a sudden, I feel like as a result of all the work I put in at the start of the year, on the rare end of twenty twenty two Mhmm.\n\nAs a lagging lagging indicator, things started performing. The business started growing, and that's when, I guess, things started picking up. But at the start, yeah, it was tough. I didn't really know anything, so I was just figuring it out. You know?\n\nOkay. So the at that stage, was it literally trial and error?\n\nYou would Yeah.\n\nWow. That's that's insane. And it's it's very interesting that you went through that pathway because you didn't even look for help. I think it as you said, it was we came to you, which is very unusual.\n\nI think it's probably one of the only people that we have reached out to, on that side of things. Okay. Beautiful. So when that initial conversation happened, Charlie reached out to you.\n\nI remember him telling me he liked you because you you just seemed very confident on the sales calls. Right?\n\nNot on the sales calls, on the on the cold calls that you were taking. Yeah. At that stage, had you managed to to sign on some clients as of yet?\n\nI think I had a couple here and there. Initially, my first I think it was my first five clients I signed through cold calls, d cold outbound DMs on Instagram, Facebook.\n\nBut I was labeling them as closes, but it was really just me being a glorified freelancer doing absolutely everything and just getting paid a commission of everybody that I booked in. So it was, like, fifty pound per appointment I was booking in. And I had, like, five of them, and it was good, but it was hard because then I was trying to market the business, dial, take sales call, build a good product, hire a team. And at the same time, I was calling my clients' leads, like, twelve hours a day.\n\nSo it was all compounded into one thing. I wouldn't label it as me having the proper clients. I'd say I was a glorified freelancer getting paid a decent amount a month for it. Yeah.\n\nOkay. Cool. And at that stage, do you remember how many hours you were putting into actually doing the work on a on a daily basis when you were in that glorified freelancer stage?\n\nIt must have been a I I don't remember a day where I haven't worked, so I was, like, year and a half. There's not really been a day where I've took a day off.\n\nAnd it's not out of, like it's not because I didn't it's not because I don't want to. It's just I just enjoy what I do. You know? So I just wanna work in it. But I then it was probably, like, sixteen hours, something like that. Jesus Christ.\n\nOkay. Cool. Well, I guess that kind of brings us to the point where you dive into the product.\n\nMhmm.\n\nI think you must have probably jumped into the product around March, so it would have been a year ago, around this time a year ago. What what were your initial thoughts on the product? How did it help with all of these problems that you are facing, those sixteen hour days that you were doing at the time? How did it help you to streamline things?\n\nI would say the biggest thing was going through the self transcendence portion, which I actually went back to in January because I didn't get chance to finish it all because there's just so much to go through. It's absolutely insane.\n\nAnd I went back to it, and it get it just got better the second time I went through it. Because I know everybody talks about the strategy, but I I truly think that a lot of the strategy is already out there.\n\nMhmm.\n\nIt's it's what you do with that information. And if you're willing to go through what it takes to to get the outcome that you want, like, in order to get what you want, you have to deserve what you want. Right?\n\nI think a big piece of that is, like, the the self transcendence as it's labeled. Becoming somebody worthy of the business that you wanna own, of the body that you wanna have.\n\nGoing through that was a game changer, and it kind of confused me a lot, but it was it was that's what was the turning point for me, going through that.\n\nOkay. And when you say that it was the turning point for you, what kind of shift started happening for you in terms of your parent times, in terms of your limiting beliefs?\n\nOne big thing was just realizing that goals are there, not necessarily goals should be hygiene standards, and that was a big shift for me. Rather than setting these goals of a hundred k a month and things like that, it's not a hundred k a month is the eventual goal in maybe five years.\n\nIt's a hundred k a month is the hygiene standard. If I am not making a hundred thousand dollars a month coming into my bank, I feel disgusted.\n\nJust something so simple like that and going through the oscillations of the life cycles and building out what my life needs to look like in order to become somebody deserving of a business that makes that amount of money and reading it every single morning. Because because I was one of those that got so tied up in, like, yeah, the sixteen hour days.\n\nIt's like riding getting on a boat with no sense of direction.\n\nLike, you just get so tied up in all the chaos and the bullshit and the to dos and the Slack notifications, but I was never zooming out and looking, okay. This is the big picture. This is where we need to stare the shit. This is where we're aiming towards. Right? And I think that was a big game changer. Setting hygiene standards, having a clear cut understanding as to where the shit was headed and how to get it there.\n\nOkay. So at that point, you feel like you've got a little bit more direction, and it's conceptually a lot easier for you to understand how you are actually going to become the person that you are now. Right?\n\nBeyond that point, what were the the things that you gained from the product that really helped you to simplify the chaos that was that was going on at that point in time, like the sixteen hour days? How did you slowly start transitioning away from that and getting back into the position where you're working on the business instead of necessarily in it?\n\nUh-huh.\n\nRealizing that I didn't need to do everything and going through the hiring portion was a big part as well.\n\nI was always so initially, I didn't really know how to hire, of course, because I've never done it before. So I'd I'd pay somebody, like, one k each time I wanted wanted to hire a Filipino VA to place them, and then I'd be paying them, like, a twenty percent commission or, like, a twenty percent additional fee month to month.\n\nAnd I did that for, like, the first six people behind.\n\nIt was a mess.\n\nOh my oh my god, Cameron.\n\nYeah. Yeah. That was kinda stupid until I realized how easy it really was. Mhmm. If you have the right qualification forms in place, if you're running the right ads, if you're on the right job platforms, things like that.\n\nAnd just looking at every single task through a lens of, is this something that I can automate, delegate, eliminate? Is this worth my cost per hour? Like, really zooming out and going, okay. The business is making twenty k right now.\n\nI'm working ten hours a day. That means my time's worth, for example, two hundred dollars an hour. Is updating a client's ad worth two hundred dollars an hour, or can I get somebody for five dollars an hour to refresh that creative? And just delegating those pieces and focusing on the only two things that actually move the money you need, which is mainly sales and marketing.\n\nAnd then everything else can mostly be delegated besides, of course, monitoring, working on, building a strong team culture, building a solid team.\n\nSo, yeah, that was the biggest thing that got me to go from working on in the business, feeling like I needed to keep tight to my money the whole time and not hire anybody and keep margins as as big as possible to then working on it, delegate and automate and then eliminating everything.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo you basically as much as possible.\n\nYou basically did a a complete one eighty. You, you probably got to that point right where because you've been putting in so much time doing sixteen hours that you were so sick of it that it was a case of, like, I need to get this off my hands as quickly as possible. Okay. That's interesting.\n\nIn terms of, like, the community, in terms of using the support mechanisms, were you super active with that, or was it more just a case of you had your head down, you were happy cracking on by yourself, you knew what you needed to do at this stage because you had a step by step process?\n\nYeah. To be honest, I didn't really use this community and support too much, but every time I have, it's been helpful. Like, I looked in the classroom the other day because I haven't really been on many of the calls. I was like, holy shit.\n\nWhy is it so many calls? No. I said, oh, no. It's weird. I was like, okay.\n\nFair. So now every time I jump into school, at least I know I can jump in a call. Like, the, one of them was extra helpful was the performance coaching. So I jumped on that a couple of times with Billy.\n\nThat was good in terms of optimizing health. For me, it was never a case of I didn't know what to do. Mhmm. I think it was just a case of just doing it without pain avoidance because I made the mistake before with other coaching programs and other systems that I've put in place. Like, putting so much time into, like, information overload even though I already knew what I needed to do. So I just wanted to put my head down and focus on the thing that I needed to do. You know?\n\nOkay. That makes sense. Another thing that I I kind of wanna touch on is, obviously, we did a we did a mastermind back in October, and you you came through to that with a couple of the other guys.\n\nWhat was that experience like being at a mastermind?\n\nWas that your first mastermind that you'd been to having It was.\n\nOkay.\n\nYeah. That was in I'll be honest. That was really good.\n\nAnd what would you say fucking good.\n\nWhat what would you say were the the key takeaways that that you got from that three day event?\n\nBecause it like, I've considered going to Masterminds. Funny enough, I've been to, like, two or three others now purely because I just loved it so much. I just wanted to be in rooms like that again and again and again.\n\nIt's gonna sound cliche, but, again, the the connections, the networking, being around people that sit next to you, and they're just like, yeah. I'll just make, like, five hundred k. It's just five hundred k a month. It's just nothing.\n\nLike, it completely breaks your mental barrier. Like, you see somebody on Zoom, it's a little bit different in a group setting. You see they're sat next to you on a table and you realize, this guy is just normal. Right?\n\nHe's just a normal geezer. You know?\n\nThat's what really shifted my mind. And at the same time, like, again, all of the mindset stuff we went over, all of the strategy, the connections. I still speak to a handful of the people that I met at that event on a week to week basis. We meet you up every now and again. So just those connections, like lifelong friends that will come from events like that is is incredible too.\n\nAnd this is this is one thing that I I as I've said this so many times in client interviews, but one thing that I think is so understated about just getting in a product of some sort, especially when you've got quality people in there, it is that network effect. It is that hygiene standard just immediately gets raised because you're surrounded by a different caliber of people, and it changes your perspective on what is normal and what you can accomplish. So that's that's fantastic.\n\nOkay. Well, Cameron, I guess to to push this more towards the direction of of people who might be sitting on the fence.\n\nFor somebody who's, you know, watching this interview, watching some of the other client interviews, maybe has jumped on a call with me, jumped on a call with some of the other guys, and they're not sure whether or not this is actually gonna help them, What is it that you would say to someone who's who's in that position at the moment?\n\nI've been in that position, and the scariest thing to to be in the scariest position to be in is in that paralysis period where you do I do it? Do I not? Honestly, worst case scenario, you spend some money and maybe you don't like it. But the the way I see it is you either pay with time or you pay with money. Like, regardless of if you need things right now. Like, honestly, when I came into the program, I didn't need anything.\n\nIt wasn't a need.\n\nHowever, I knew damn right it would elevate or accelerate my progression because I would be around other people. I would make connections because you are who you surround yourself with as well. And if you don't have that caliber of person in your environment on the day to day, which I don't because I'm in the middle of nowhere, you need that.\n\nYep.\n\nAnd that's the biggest thing for me. Just the community, the coaching. Like, I would be happy to pay for a program just for the networking piece alone because I knew know that it will make me more money as a byproduct of me just being around better people.\n\nBeautiful. Yeah. I agree with you on that front. Okay. Last last two questions then. First one, Cameron, what is the goal, brother?\n\nWhat is the goal for twenty twenty four? Where do you wanna take the business?\n\nWhat are you looking to do?\n\nMhmm.\n\nYeah. So the goal for twenty twenty four in the business is one point six million revenue, so they're eight percent sure. And that's the goal top line revenue.\n\nWe want two hundred and fifty active clients under management, thirty five percent margin.\n\nAnd then, eventually, in the next twelve to thirty six months, sell cash out for, like, a rate to four x multiple, and then, I don't know, figure figure things out from there. But that that's the goal that I'm focused on right now.\n\nK. Beautiful. Last thing, Cameron, is there anything that you want to to share? I think, to be honest with you, especially given your age, and you've seen this.\n\nI've seen this myself. Especially because of people like Andrew Tate. We've got people like Charlie. There's a ton of very influential guys out there right now who are really speaking to your generation and really showing them a different path that they can they can walk.\n\nYou being that guy, right, eighteen years old, making a hundred k on a monthly basis, what is it that you would say to, you know, some of the peers that you might have at school who are thinking about the fact that they're gonna be stuck in a nine to five x, y, and z? What is something that you can share with them to kind of push them in a better direction?\n\nJust zoom out.\n\nI know it sounds cliche, but just zoom out and think, like, do you, and you've probably heard it before, but you really wanna die.\n\nLike, you don't live for long. Like, you live a very, very short period of time. Nothing really matters.\n\nNonetheless, I just think it's important to do something that's true to you. You know? Because otherwise, then you're gonna die, and you're gonna be pretty depressed for the whole of your life.\n\nFor me, anyway, again, I know some people are different, but Mhmm. I just wouldn't I wouldn't wanna live as somebody else internally as I felt as I acted externally. Like, they've gotta be in sync with one another. If you feel internally that a nine to five isn't for you and you wanna become a leader and you wanna do good, cool shit and live a good life and have a mission and a purpose, then if you don't express that externally, you're always gonna be out of sync and you're never gonna have peace of mind.\n\nAnd I think a lot of people know that, but how do they overcome that fear of actually taking the the steps, having the confidence to become that person?\n\nI think the confidence comes as a byproduct of taking the leap even though you don't know where it's gonna get you. I don't think you just build the confidence out of the gate. Because I'm still building it now, and it all comes with microaction on a macro scale compounds. And those actions then have people label you over a period of time as confident or disciplined.\n\nYeah. I really agree with that. And this is something that I say to a lot of people in the sales calls. You know, when someone jumps on the call and they're like, they're similarly to your age and they say, look. I wanna get to ten k, twenty k, thirty k, whatever it might be. And then they're fearful to take that step forwards As best as I can, I try to explain them that that threshold of overcoming the fear is integral to the process of getting to your goal? And if you can't do it, you're not gonna make it.\n\nBut, anyway, Cameron, brother, I really appreciate it. I appreciate the time. I'm excited to see what you do with the rest of this year. And, yeah, brother. I wish you the best of luck.\n\nYeah. Appreciate it."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}}, {});
