It's Charlie Morgan here and welcome to another video for the channel. Today, I'm joined by George, one of our clients from Easy Grow. And in this video, he's gonna share how he used our program to go from zero to twenty thousand dollars per month.\n\nGet this in four months. The dude was full time employed at Amazon prior to working with us. By the way, look at this view. How gorgeous is this, man?\n\nI'm in Stockholm at the moment, in Sweden. I'm sure you knew where Stockholm was. I didn't really have to clarify that. And I'm right by a lake and, honestly, very calm, very peaceful.\n\nAnd I'd tell you what else is calm and peaceful, and that is George, mate, because George is amazing. And in this video, he's gonna explain how he used to program. And he literally just I just I didn't even I knew he was a client, but he posted some stuff in our group, paid group, and then he was like I was like, how much do you make? And I was like, oh, I did, like, eighteen grand this month.\n\nAnd I was like, how much were you making when you started? He was like, zero. I was like, when did you start? He was like, like, four months ago, and I was like, oh, client interview time.\n\nSo this one is with George. I hope it gives you some inspiration. Obviously, full disclaimer, this is a sales thing. Right?\n\nIt's designed to get you to buy the program, blah blah blah. But maybe it will inspire you to buy the thing and get similar results. Without further ado, we shall cut the clip in. If you want to buy my stuff, there's a link in the description.\n\nClick it if you dare. See you later. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another client interview. Today, I have the wonderful George with his wonderful hairline, that I am ever so jealous of.\n\nIn today's video, we're gonna be walking through George's story with our program.\n\nI'm gonna provide some context, but the the real gist of the story is George went from full time employee to twenty k a month agency owner over the course of about four months of working with us. It's a pretty cool story, and George is here to tell us. So, George, why don't you just start by introducing yourself. Tell people about who you are, what your niche is, and then we'll get into the nitty gritty stuff.\n\nCool. Yep. Thanks for having me on this, Charlie.\n\nYeah. So in terms of niche and story, so I was at Amazon, just didn't enjoy being in a corporate environment.\n\nMhmm.\n\nAnd wanted to do my own thing. I've always wanted to do my own thing and felt like I finally had the skill set to do so. So, basically found Charlie through his YouTube channel, hopped on a sales call, program looked really legit, and prior to even leaving, joined the program.\n\nFrom anywhere like, from late December to February first. I was just in there poking around, learning, you know, interacting with the team. And then February first started up, an Amazon agency looking to just drive profitable growth in sales to, Amazon sellers and vendors.\n\nThat was good stuff, man. So so George started in January of, basically, this year to twenty three. We're now sort of nearing towards the end of May. So it's effectively been like, you said the first month, you didn't really do any outreach. You weren't using the system. So it's been about five months since you joined, but, realistically, four of you account that you weren't doing outreach till February.\n\nTell the people how much money you made this month.\n\nSo this month of May, we'll finish at about eighteen k. And then for June, we have three clients starting in June. So we should be couple of our percentage of sales and spend deals. So it should be twenty five k ish for June.\n\nRight. So full time employee, you quit your job, and then you got the twenty k a month over the course of four months. How how do you feel?\n\nThat must be pretty good, man.\n\nFeel good, but it's can always be better. You know? Can always keep growing itself.\n\nI mean, it feels amazing, but not content trying to grow, trying to interview, trying to get more clients.\n\nSo That's good, man.\n\nSo let's talk about, the the beginning of it. So you were in a job. Walk me through, how you felt at the job. Because, obviously, you Mhmm. I'm assuming you felt like you could do more, and you were more than just, like, the corporate environment. But what frustrated you about that, and why did you wanna break free, essentially?\n\nFrom you and so my quota increased. I think it was, like, a hundred sixty four percent year over year, and my pay ended up going down, just because it was an outrageously high quota. And if you just look at the numbers year over year, so I had, like, a three million quota, and it went up to eight million. And I drove, like, seven point eight million dollars in sales.\n\nSorry. This is complicated. I drove about seven point eight ish or whatever it was in twenty twenty two. But in twenty twenty one, I only did about three something million, and I got paid less.\n\nSo I knew if I had a business and I grew up from three million to seven million, you know, my salary or my pay would go up significantly too. So I figured, you know, it makes sense to do my own thing and just build my own business and take a risk, and there'll probably be an l in the short term, but, hopefully, the long term w if I can replicate my success. So that was my thought process. Biggest thing was just I wanna get paid what I'm worth.\n\nYeah. I hate you, man. So the the being paid what you're worth is obviously a huge part of it. Did it have anything to do with the freedom?\n\nLike, not having a boss, working where you want, working your own time, like, going to work in T shirts, man. It's pretty fun.\n\nYeah. Yeah. So I was in a pretty chill environment just being tech, fully remote to do whatever. But, to that point, I think not having a boss is super nice still.\n\nWhen you work at a place like Amazon, it's a lot of just the corporate goals that you have to follow. Now I'm kinda following my own goals and kind of taking my own path. So I think from, like, a goal setting and, like, the direction of the business, it's really nice.\n\nAnd I just can do whatever I think is best, and don't have to say, okay. This quarter, we're doing this goal or that quarter, we're doing this goal or we're doing this sales sprint currently or whatever it might be. So that is nice.\n\nThat's good. So you so you finished You you quit the job before you start doing outreach. What gave you the confidence to do that? So, obviously, that's quite a big decision to take.\n\nA lot of people dream of working for Amazon. Right? It's like some people's dream come before. So what what gave you the confidence, the conviction to sort of say, right.\n\nThis is a well calculated risk, and it's gonna work out.\n\nThat's a good question. So, I've been saving my commission checks just to make sure I was good. And, basically, what I did is I set it up so that, my lease ended in June or sorry, end of May. And so I had it set up that I could pay for my entire lifestyle all the way from point of quitting, February first, all the way till my lease ending May. So worst case scenario, I move home to my parents' house and keep going.\n\nSo that was just kind of the structure I had to make sure I was financially sound. And then in terms of, like, mentally, it's just looking at the people that are being successful, people that are either younger than me or older than me and thinking I could probably do that too if I invest the time. So for me, I was like, okay. I'm gonna quit quit and commit for one year. And at the end of one year, if I'm just doing terrible, I'll go to Walmart or Target or whatever and get a job.\n\nBut in the meantime, this is amazing opportunity that I continue to see people succeeding in, so I might as well shoot my shot as well.\n\nMhmm. That's amazing, man. So you find them on on YouTube, and then you booked a call. Because you purchased before easy grow launch, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nSo Yes. Yep. Right before. So So you would've spent that first month going through, like, the normal content.\n\nSo Mhmm. To to build the business you've got now, the agency, what strategies do you use from Easy Grow? Is it cold email? Are you cold DMing?\n\nBecause literally, we haven't heard from you. You know, I was like, I suppose in the community and you were like, yeah. I saw another clip. I was like, how much is this dude making it? Like, what's his story? So so talk to me about, like, the the actual process of building the thing and what systems you use. Yeah.\n\nSo for me, it's been straight cold calling. I think I'm the best on the phone. I think I can, objection handle well. I think I can figure out what a client's goals are really well and speak to it.\n\nSo, when I joined, I was trying a bunch of the different, like, cold like, whether it's email or DM approaches, but I think his name was Jeffrey. He was just going ham on cold calls and just booking meetings constantly and posting about it. So I was like, alright. I gotta switch to cold calls, give that a shot.\n\nAnd kinda like multiple people in the, program were doing really well through cold calls. So I was like, okay. We're just gonna start cold calling.\n\nStarted cold calling, saw a lot of success there, and just kept going with it. So cold calls been my number one form of outreach. And then right now, currently going through all the Facebook ads modules that Bo put up and trying to get Facebook ads launched, as soon as possible.\n\nAmazing, man. And as for the other stuff in the program, did you use a mindset module? Was there any sales systems you used? I mean, talk to people about what else you use.\n\nYeah. So for the program, mindset module is my, Saturday morning. I was doing cup of coffee, mindset module, one point two five x. Just Mhmm. How I started my Saturdays for, like, a month and a half or something.\n\nOh, so week?\n\nYeah. I was doing one a week. So I was just doing one mindset module every Saturday morning because they're, like, you know, two and a half, three hours of pretty good content. So So Yeah.\n\nI wouldn't wanna do, like, three in a row. I think my brain would be dead by that point. So just take it all in, digest that one, then go to the next, then go to the next. And there's also, like, follow-up stuff of, like, activities within it to make you just dive deeper.\n\nSo just wanna make sure I'm investing the time necessary into one mindset module before going to the, you know, next one, etcetera. So did that. A lot of the hiring stuff as well has been really helpful. They kinda outline for me, coming from corporate, like, I didn't have an agency existing.\n\nSo they had a lot of, like, okay. At this point, you need a lead gen person immediately. So my mind just alright. I'm getting a lead gen.\n\nOkay. At this point, you get your media buyer. So then I'm check checking out the higher media buyer. What do I pay them?\n\nHaven't ever done that before. So I've been just kinda following that structure as well.\n\nAnd, yeah, that's kind of the stuff I've been investigating. So did all the cold outreach and then moved into the mindset and then the hiring training stuff.\n\nMakes sense. So what does the structure of the agency look like now?\n\nHow many clients do you have, and and do you have a team yet, or are you still willing to Yeah.\n\nGood question as well. So structured the agency.\n\nSo I have some clients that I'm working with, but I have one media buyer for lack of a better word, but we're doing, like, PPC and SEO, so it's kind of a combo. I guess account manager.\n\nHe's running with about eight accounts right now. He's a ten ninety nine contractor. Mhmm. Currently interviewing for an additional ten ninety nine contractor, because I just need somebody else to take on more clients.\n\nSo And then I have What does what does ten ninety nine contractor mean?\n\nOh, yeah. Yeah. Sorry. So, like, the w two employee in the US is like a salaried full benefit employee. A ten ninety nine contractors, like, no benefits, not salaried.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo I have two of those account managers.\n\nI got two people for content. So we help with, like, a plus content, video, images, just stuff to help drive conversion rate. And then I have a couple people, that are just, like, overseas for, like, lead gen or, like, back end support, stuff like that. So small team, but growing.\n\nMakes sense, dude.\n\nSo what I'd like to know, what was the pivotal moment of, like, either a lesson or mindset shift where you where it just took off? Because, obviously, going from you quit your job, you're making no money, and then three, four months later, you're making twenty k a month. Walk me through some of the key moments where you sort of had, like, a light bulb moment or something. But did you know what I mean? The big points of leverage.\n\nYeah. Asking the deep questions here, I gotta think.\n\nDude, there's no man to do, man. People wanna know.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nPivotal moments. Okay. So I think pivotal moment number one is just getting everything together. So, when I'm first joining in, just figuring out all this stuff in regards to how do I even generate leads, how do I even start cold calling, etcetera, and getting that process going. Because initially, it's just me doing my thing.\n\nPivotal moment number two would then be figuring out how to actually hire, and bringing somebody on to continue to expand. So I'd say those are the first two. I think, currently, ads will be the next pivotable moment.\n\nI just mispronunciated that so badly. But, yeah, something like that, I I'd say. And I think just along the way, just keeping, like, a learning and growth mindset of, like, how do I keep getting better? How do I keep doing this better? How do I improve?\n\nSo, yeah, just kinda those things.\n\nSo talking about ads, what is next? What's the next goal?\n\nYour next goal, I wanna get to fifty k, minimum. Probably early q four would be nice if I replicate what I've done in h one, which should be accelerated just due to the fact that I know everything I know currently.\n\nMhmm.\n\nWe should be able to do fifty k by early q four. And then next year, I wanna get to a legitimate million dollar agency. So a hundred k per month in twenty twenty four.\n\nYeah, baby. I don't know if there's any reason why you shouldn't let the trajectory you're on. You know, it's it's amazing. It takes I mean, most businesses, it takes them, like, three or four years to get to twenty k a month. You know? So it's such a high leverage model, man. So congratulations.\n\nThank you. So now the part where I ask you to sell my thing for me. Yeah.\n\nBut in all seriousness, if because, obviously, you know, we make these videos Mhmm.\n\nAs a method of social proof. Right? So that people can see, like, George is a real human. He's not AI. As you can tell, like, he's a human. Right? As I think, as far as I'm concerned.\n\nI'm from Chad GPT.\n\nExactly. I've preprogrammed him to say the right things. But in all seriousness, if if you were, if if if if you were talking to someone on the fence and they were like, oh, like, I'm in a full time job or, like, I'm I wanna start. I'm not sure what to do. Like but they they were sort of unconvinced. Like, what advice would you give them or what would you say?\n\nYeah. For me, I think kinda like what I walk through, on a couple different questions is leaving a full time job you're not used to having, no sort of social proof to what Charlie was just saying. Right? You have the Amazon email. People automatically reply. Like, you have social proof built in. Or if you're at a different big corporation, whatever, consulting firm, etcetera.\n\nSo it's kind of figuring out how do I, you know, basically start from the ground up. And it's, like, it is as basic as just figuring out lead gen To a lot of agency owners, that's probably very fundamental. But to somebody who either was at tech or in consulting, you've never had to do the lead gen. You kinda just had things handed to you.\n\nSo just that step one. And the and the program is gonna walk you through the whole process. Right? I know it's kind of dubbed as a client acquisition program.\n\nFor me, it was like a holistic agency program of here's how we do everything.\n\nI think client acquisition is the best part, but I think, like, it's taught me, like, like, everything in regards to, okay. Here's how we're gonna hire. Here's this at this point, you need to hire that person, that point, that person, etcetera. So I think lead gen is step one, where it'll just teach you like, hey.\n\nJust outsource. Get a lead gen person to start getting those leads for you. Then focus all your time and attention on client acquisition rather than spending a ton of money or sorry, a ton of time on identifying, you know, who you wanna call, or not who you want yeah. Who you wanna call.\n\nAnd then it's okay.\n\nHow do we get you really good at that client acquisition part, which is what they're gonna dive into? So like Charlie mentioned, for me, cold calling. But they have cold DMs. They have cold emails.\n\nThey have ads if you have a higher, you know, quantity of money in your pocket already. So they have all these different client outreach methods where you pick one and you can run with it. And you can also join in these different like, they have weekly meetings where you can join in and say, hey. How do I do this better?\n\nHow do I do that better? I've asked a few questions there, and I've also interact with Nor who's kind of the operator. I was like, hey, Noor. Can you review my cold call script?\n\nCan you review my, you know, case study or whatever it might be? And they're just giving you another perspective. So I'd say for me personally, coming from a corporate environment, and if somebody else is coming from a corporate environment, it's just been a holistic, like, one on one. This is how we do an agency.\n\nThis is how you do it properly, and this is how you get clients through it. So that's my take. That's my perspective.\n\nBut yeah.\n\nYeah. And a big shout out to.\n\nYeah. Very helpful. So one one thing I always I'm trying to get to the habit of sadness on client interviews because a lot of people are gonna look at you, and they're gonna their expectations won't be set properly. You must have worked really hard for this.\n\nRight? Yeah. That's another thing.\n\nYou know, I can imagine you've really put in a lot of time and effort. Mhmm. You know, you've you've probably suffered quite a lot over the last few months to to make this thing and build it. And I want everyone watching this to know that, like, if you do wanna buy the thing, do it. But please don't think it's gonna be easy. Like, you know, I'm sure his hairline was a little bit further forward before he started. Let's put it that way.\n\nNo. I just need a haircut. Even possible.\n\nIt's bad right now. I just just need a haircut. No.\n\nYeah. I mean, definitely, you're gonna have to work hard at it, I think, to to some stuff that Charlie mentions in modules over and over again. So you can't just do ten DMs and expect to get, you know, fifty clients. You gotta put in the work.\n\nSo Yeah.\n\nFor me, I remember I would, accounting is another thing you gotta do, right, if you're running a business. So I remember I was just kinda bookkeeping, tracking my clients, making sure I'm getting my invoices, etcetera, etcetera. That's taking me some time. I get a call.\n\nIt's like Saturday. My friend's like, what have you been up to all day? I'm like, I've been working on my books for three hours. Trying to make sure this thing's running right.\n\nHe's like, what? Like, why would you do that? I'm like, I'm a business owner. Like, that's how it works.\n\nSo, yeah, you have to put in the work. You know, just for me, it's like setting an outreach block every single day where I'm going in and doing the outreach. I'm setting a client delivery block. We're going in.\n\nI'm doing my client service every every day. It's gonna be more hours for sure, but I think the long term payoff, for me I mean, I've enjoyed it way more, and I think it has way more upside.\n\nSo yeah.\n\nI love it, man. If literally, I'm gonna put that on my video ideas, for YouTube, like an outreach blog because I've liked this. I'm always on the hunt for new video ideas, and I think that'd be quite useful for people. Just shout at them for ten minutes and say, set aside some time to do outreach and just do that every day.\n\nBut, dude, I mean, that's all that that's I mean, like, for me, this this Zoom thing was honestly more for my curiosity than anything. I was like, oh, I know we have a good product, but, like, sometimes it it does be a lot the the issue we have is, like, a lot of people work behind the scenes, and they don't communicate too much with us. And then suddenly, out of nowhere, we find these incredible results. And, you know Yeah.\n\nThank you for your hard work, man, and representing and also coming on. I'm sure this is gonna inspire a lot of people to take actions to get the same thing you did. So dude, that's everything for me. Unless there's anything else you wanna talk about, maybe where can people find you, Instagram?\n\nI mean, are you bothered about that stuff or not?\n\nI'm like, you can plug in LinkedIn, my name.\n\nYou can find me there. Yeah. That's about it.\n\nTom.\n\nBut but thank you to you too as well, Charlie, and for all the time into the modules.\n\nWell, dude, you you bought the thing, so thank you.\n\nMutually beneficial relationship. George, thank you, brother. I'll, I'll talk to you soon. And, everyone watching this, go and subscribe and like.\n\nAnd if you want similar stuff, George, results wise, click the first thing in the description. It will be explained there. You can click it. If you if you don't wanna click it, it's fine.\n\nRight. Nice one, guys. See you later.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/a1pnbfgap5?autoplay=0&wmode=transparent&wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

It's Charlie Morgan here and welcome to another video for the channel. Today, I'm joined by George, one of our clients from Easy Grow. And in this video, he's gonna share how he used our program to go from zero to twenty thousand dollars per month.\n\nGet this in four months. The dude was full time employed at Amazon prior to working with us. By the way, look at this view. How gorgeous is this, man?\n\nI'm in Stockholm at the moment, in Sweden. I'm sure you knew where Stockholm was. I didn't really have to clarify that. And I'm right by a lake and, honestly, very calm, very peaceful.\n\nAnd I'd tell you what else is calm and peaceful, and that is George, mate, because George is amazing. And in this video, he's gonna explain how he used to program. And he literally just I just I didn't even I knew he was a client, but he posted some stuff in our group, paid group, and then he was like I was like, how much do you make? And I was like, oh, I did, like, eighteen grand this month.\n\nAnd I was like, how much were you making when you started? He was like, zero. I was like, when did you start? He was like, like, four months ago, and I was like, oh, client interview time.\n\nSo this one is with George. I hope it gives you some inspiration. Obviously, full disclaimer, this is a sales thing. Right?\n\nIt's designed to get you to buy the program, blah blah blah. But maybe it will inspire you to buy the thing and get similar results. Without further ado, we shall cut the clip in. If you want to buy my stuff, there's a link in the description.\n\nClick it if you dare. See you later. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another client interview. Today, I have the wonderful George with his wonderful hairline, that I am ever so jealous of.\n\nIn today's video, we're gonna be walking through George's story with our program.\n\nI'm gonna provide some context, but the the real gist of the story is George went from full time employee to twenty k a month agency owner over the course of about four months of working with us. It's a pretty cool story, and George is here to tell us. So, George, why don't you just start by introducing yourself. Tell people about who you are, what your niche is, and then we'll get into the nitty gritty stuff.\n\nCool. Yep. Thanks for having me on this, Charlie.\n\nYeah. So in terms of niche and story, so I was at Amazon, just didn't enjoy being in a corporate environment.\n\nMhmm.\n\nAnd wanted to do my own thing. I've always wanted to do my own thing and felt like I finally had the skill set to do so. So, basically found Charlie through his YouTube channel, hopped on a sales call, program looked really legit, and prior to even leaving, joined the program.\n\nFrom anywhere like, from late December to February first. I was just in there poking around, learning, you know, interacting with the team. And then February first started up, an Amazon agency looking to just drive profitable growth in sales to, Amazon sellers and vendors.\n\nThat was good stuff, man. So so George started in January of, basically, this year to twenty three. We're now sort of nearing towards the end of May. So it's effectively been like, you said the first month, you didn't really do any outreach. You weren't using the system. So it's been about five months since you joined, but, realistically, four of you account that you weren't doing outreach till February.\n\nTell the people how much money you made this month.\n\nSo this month of May, we'll finish at about eighteen k. And then for June, we have three clients starting in June. So we should be couple of our percentage of sales and spend deals. So it should be twenty five k ish for June.\n\nRight. So full time employee, you quit your job, and then you got the twenty k a month over the course of four months. How how do you feel?\n\nThat must be pretty good, man.\n\nFeel good, but it's can always be better. You know? Can always keep growing itself.\n\nI mean, it feels amazing, but not content trying to grow, trying to interview, trying to get more clients.\n\nSo That's good, man.\n\nSo let's talk about, the the beginning of it. So you were in a job. Walk me through, how you felt at the job. Because, obviously, you Mhmm. I'm assuming you felt like you could do more, and you were more than just, like, the corporate environment. But what frustrated you about that, and why did you wanna break free, essentially?\n\nFrom you and so my quota increased. I think it was, like, a hundred sixty four percent year over year, and my pay ended up going down, just because it was an outrageously high quota. And if you just look at the numbers year over year, so I had, like, a three million quota, and it went up to eight million. And I drove, like, seven point eight million dollars in sales.\n\nSorry. This is complicated. I drove about seven point eight ish or whatever it was in twenty twenty two. But in twenty twenty one, I only did about three something million, and I got paid less.\n\nSo I knew if I had a business and I grew up from three million to seven million, you know, my salary or my pay would go up significantly too. So I figured, you know, it makes sense to do my own thing and just build my own business and take a risk, and there'll probably be an l in the short term, but, hopefully, the long term w if I can replicate my success. So that was my thought process. Biggest thing was just I wanna get paid what I'm worth.\n\nYeah. I hate you, man. So the the being paid what you're worth is obviously a huge part of it. Did it have anything to do with the freedom?\n\nLike, not having a boss, working where you want, working your own time, like, going to work in T shirts, man. It's pretty fun.\n\nYeah. Yeah. So I was in a pretty chill environment just being tech, fully remote to do whatever. But, to that point, I think not having a boss is super nice still.\n\nWhen you work at a place like Amazon, it's a lot of just the corporate goals that you have to follow. Now I'm kinda following my own goals and kind of taking my own path. So I think from, like, a goal setting and, like, the direction of the business, it's really nice.\n\nAnd I just can do whatever I think is best, and don't have to say, okay. This quarter, we're doing this goal or that quarter, we're doing this goal or we're doing this sales sprint currently or whatever it might be. So that is nice.\n\nThat's good. So you so you finished You you quit the job before you start doing outreach. What gave you the confidence to do that? So, obviously, that's quite a big decision to take.\n\nA lot of people dream of working for Amazon. Right? It's like some people's dream come before. So what what gave you the confidence, the conviction to sort of say, right.\n\nThis is a well calculated risk, and it's gonna work out.\n\nThat's a good question. So, I've been saving my commission checks just to make sure I was good. And, basically, what I did is I set it up so that, my lease ended in June or sorry, end of May. And so I had it set up that I could pay for my entire lifestyle all the way from point of quitting, February first, all the way till my lease ending May. So worst case scenario, I move home to my parents' house and keep going.\n\nSo that was just kind of the structure I had to make sure I was financially sound. And then in terms of, like, mentally, it's just looking at the people that are being successful, people that are either younger than me or older than me and thinking I could probably do that too if I invest the time. So for me, I was like, okay. I'm gonna quit quit and commit for one year. And at the end of one year, if I'm just doing terrible, I'll go to Walmart or Target or whatever and get a job.\n\nBut in the meantime, this is amazing opportunity that I continue to see people succeeding in, so I might as well shoot my shot as well.\n\nMhmm. That's amazing, man. So you find them on on YouTube, and then you booked a call. Because you purchased before easy grow launch, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nSo Yes. Yep. Right before. So So you would've spent that first month going through, like, the normal content.\n\nSo Mhmm. To to build the business you've got now, the agency, what strategies do you use from Easy Grow? Is it cold email? Are you cold DMing?\n\nBecause literally, we haven't heard from you. You know, I was like, I suppose in the community and you were like, yeah. I saw another clip. I was like, how much is this dude making it? Like, what's his story? So so talk to me about, like, the the actual process of building the thing and what systems you use. Yeah.\n\nSo for me, it's been straight cold calling. I think I'm the best on the phone. I think I can, objection handle well. I think I can figure out what a client's goals are really well and speak to it.\n\nSo, when I joined, I was trying a bunch of the different, like, cold like, whether it's email or DM approaches, but I think his name was Jeffrey. He was just going ham on cold calls and just booking meetings constantly and posting about it. So I was like, alright. I gotta switch to cold calls, give that a shot.\n\nAnd kinda like multiple people in the, program were doing really well through cold calls. So I was like, okay. We're just gonna start cold calling.\n\nStarted cold calling, saw a lot of success there, and just kept going with it. So cold calls been my number one form of outreach. And then right now, currently going through all the Facebook ads modules that Bo put up and trying to get Facebook ads launched, as soon as possible.\n\nAmazing, man. And as for the other stuff in the program, did you use a mindset module? Was there any sales systems you used? I mean, talk to people about what else you use.\n\nYeah. So for the program, mindset module is my, Saturday morning. I was doing cup of coffee, mindset module, one point two five x. Just Mhmm. How I started my Saturdays for, like, a month and a half or something.\n\nOh, so week?\n\nYeah. I was doing one a week. So I was just doing one mindset module every Saturday morning because they're, like, you know, two and a half, three hours of pretty good content. So So Yeah.\n\nI wouldn't wanna do, like, three in a row. I think my brain would be dead by that point. So just take it all in, digest that one, then go to the next, then go to the next. And there's also, like, follow-up stuff of, like, activities within it to make you just dive deeper.\n\nSo just wanna make sure I'm investing the time necessary into one mindset module before going to the, you know, next one, etcetera. So did that. A lot of the hiring stuff as well has been really helpful. They kinda outline for me, coming from corporate, like, I didn't have an agency existing.\n\nSo they had a lot of, like, okay. At this point, you need a lead gen person immediately. So my mind just alright. I'm getting a lead gen.\n\nOkay. At this point, you get your media buyer. So then I'm check checking out the higher media buyer. What do I pay them?\n\nHaven't ever done that before. So I've been just kinda following that structure as well.\n\nAnd, yeah, that's kind of the stuff I've been investigating. So did all the cold outreach and then moved into the mindset and then the hiring training stuff.\n\nMakes sense. So what does the structure of the agency look like now?\n\nHow many clients do you have, and and do you have a team yet, or are you still willing to Yeah.\n\nGood question as well. So structured the agency.\n\nSo I have some clients that I'm working with, but I have one media buyer for lack of a better word, but we're doing, like, PPC and SEO, so it's kind of a combo. I guess account manager.\n\nHe's running with about eight accounts right now. He's a ten ninety nine contractor. Mhmm. Currently interviewing for an additional ten ninety nine contractor, because I just need somebody else to take on more clients.\n\nSo And then I have What does what does ten ninety nine contractor mean?\n\nOh, yeah. Yeah. Sorry. So, like, the w two employee in the US is like a salaried full benefit employee. A ten ninety nine contractors, like, no benefits, not salaried.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo I have two of those account managers.\n\nI got two people for content. So we help with, like, a plus content, video, images, just stuff to help drive conversion rate. And then I have a couple people, that are just, like, overseas for, like, lead gen or, like, back end support, stuff like that. So small team, but growing.\n\nMakes sense, dude.\n\nSo what I'd like to know, what was the pivotal moment of, like, either a lesson or mindset shift where you where it just took off? Because, obviously, going from you quit your job, you're making no money, and then three, four months later, you're making twenty k a month. Walk me through some of the key moments where you sort of had, like, a light bulb moment or something. But did you know what I mean? The big points of leverage.\n\nYeah. Asking the deep questions here, I gotta think.\n\nDude, there's no man to do, man. People wanna know.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nPivotal moments. Okay. So I think pivotal moment number one is just getting everything together. So, when I'm first joining in, just figuring out all this stuff in regards to how do I even generate leads, how do I even start cold calling, etcetera, and getting that process going. Because initially, it's just me doing my thing.\n\nPivotal moment number two would then be figuring out how to actually hire, and bringing somebody on to continue to expand. So I'd say those are the first two. I think, currently, ads will be the next pivotable moment.\n\nI just mispronunciated that so badly. But, yeah, something like that, I I'd say. And I think just along the way, just keeping, like, a learning and growth mindset of, like, how do I keep getting better? How do I keep doing this better? How do I improve?\n\nSo, yeah, just kinda those things.\n\nSo talking about ads, what is next? What's the next goal?\n\nYour next goal, I wanna get to fifty k, minimum. Probably early q four would be nice if I replicate what I've done in h one, which should be accelerated just due to the fact that I know everything I know currently.\n\nMhmm.\n\nWe should be able to do fifty k by early q four. And then next year, I wanna get to a legitimate million dollar agency. So a hundred k per month in twenty twenty four.\n\nYeah, baby. I don't know if there's any reason why you shouldn't let the trajectory you're on. You know, it's it's amazing. It takes I mean, most businesses, it takes them, like, three or four years to get to twenty k a month. You know? So it's such a high leverage model, man. So congratulations.\n\nThank you. So now the part where I ask you to sell my thing for me. Yeah.\n\nBut in all seriousness, if because, obviously, you know, we make these videos Mhmm.\n\nAs a method of social proof. Right? So that people can see, like, George is a real human. He's not AI. As you can tell, like, he's a human. Right? As I think, as far as I'm concerned.\n\nI'm from Chad GPT.\n\nExactly. I've preprogrammed him to say the right things. But in all seriousness, if if you were, if if if if you were talking to someone on the fence and they were like, oh, like, I'm in a full time job or, like, I'm I wanna start. I'm not sure what to do. Like but they they were sort of unconvinced. Like, what advice would you give them or what would you say?\n\nYeah. For me, I think kinda like what I walk through, on a couple different questions is leaving a full time job you're not used to having, no sort of social proof to what Charlie was just saying. Right? You have the Amazon email. People automatically reply. Like, you have social proof built in. Or if you're at a different big corporation, whatever, consulting firm, etcetera.\n\nSo it's kind of figuring out how do I, you know, basically start from the ground up. And it's, like, it is as basic as just figuring out lead gen To a lot of agency owners, that's probably very fundamental. But to somebody who either was at tech or in consulting, you've never had to do the lead gen. You kinda just had things handed to you.\n\nSo just that step one. And the and the program is gonna walk you through the whole process. Right? I know it's kind of dubbed as a client acquisition program.\n\nFor me, it was like a holistic agency program of here's how we do everything.\n\nI think client acquisition is the best part, but I think, like, it's taught me, like, like, everything in regards to, okay. Here's how we're gonna hire. Here's this at this point, you need to hire that person, that point, that person, etcetera. So I think lead gen is step one, where it'll just teach you like, hey.\n\nJust outsource. Get a lead gen person to start getting those leads for you. Then focus all your time and attention on client acquisition rather than spending a ton of money or sorry, a ton of time on identifying, you know, who you wanna call, or not who you want yeah. Who you wanna call.\n\nAnd then it's okay.\n\nHow do we get you really good at that client acquisition part, which is what they're gonna dive into? So like Charlie mentioned, for me, cold calling. But they have cold DMs. They have cold emails.\n\nThey have ads if you have a higher, you know, quantity of money in your pocket already. So they have all these different client outreach methods where you pick one and you can run with it. And you can also join in these different like, they have weekly meetings where you can join in and say, hey. How do I do this better?\n\nHow do I do that better? I've asked a few questions there, and I've also interact with Nor who's kind of the operator. I was like, hey, Noor. Can you review my cold call script?\n\nCan you review my, you know, case study or whatever it might be? And they're just giving you another perspective. So I'd say for me personally, coming from a corporate environment, and if somebody else is coming from a corporate environment, it's just been a holistic, like, one on one. This is how we do an agency.\n\nThis is how you do it properly, and this is how you get clients through it. So that's my take. That's my perspective.\n\nBut yeah.\n\nYeah. And a big shout out to.\n\nYeah. Very helpful. So one one thing I always I'm trying to get to the habit of sadness on client interviews because a lot of people are gonna look at you, and they're gonna their expectations won't be set properly. You must have worked really hard for this.\n\nRight? Yeah. That's another thing.\n\nYou know, I can imagine you've really put in a lot of time and effort. Mhmm. You know, you've you've probably suffered quite a lot over the last few months to to make this thing and build it. And I want everyone watching this to know that, like, if you do wanna buy the thing, do it. But please don't think it's gonna be easy. Like, you know, I'm sure his hairline was a little bit further forward before he started. Let's put it that way.\n\nNo. I just need a haircut. Even possible.\n\nIt's bad right now. I just just need a haircut. No.\n\nYeah. I mean, definitely, you're gonna have to work hard at it, I think, to to some stuff that Charlie mentions in modules over and over again. So you can't just do ten DMs and expect to get, you know, fifty clients. You gotta put in the work.\n\nSo Yeah.\n\nFor me, I remember I would, accounting is another thing you gotta do, right, if you're running a business. So I remember I was just kinda bookkeeping, tracking my clients, making sure I'm getting my invoices, etcetera, etcetera. That's taking me some time. I get a call.\n\nIt's like Saturday. My friend's like, what have you been up to all day? I'm like, I've been working on my books for three hours. Trying to make sure this thing's running right.\n\nHe's like, what? Like, why would you do that? I'm like, I'm a business owner. Like, that's how it works.\n\nSo, yeah, you have to put in the work. You know, just for me, it's like setting an outreach block every single day where I'm going in and doing the outreach. I'm setting a client delivery block. We're going in.\n\nI'm doing my client service every every day. It's gonna be more hours for sure, but I think the long term payoff, for me I mean, I've enjoyed it way more, and I think it has way more upside.\n\nSo yeah.\n\nI love it, man. If literally, I'm gonna put that on my video ideas, for YouTube, like an outreach blog because I've liked this. I'm always on the hunt for new video ideas, and I think that'd be quite useful for people. Just shout at them for ten minutes and say, set aside some time to do outreach and just do that every day.\n\nBut, dude, I mean, that's all that that's I mean, like, for me, this this Zoom thing was honestly more for my curiosity than anything. I was like, oh, I know we have a good product, but, like, sometimes it it does be a lot the the issue we have is, like, a lot of people work behind the scenes, and they don't communicate too much with us. And then suddenly, out of nowhere, we find these incredible results. And, you know Yeah.\n\nThank you for your hard work, man, and representing and also coming on. I'm sure this is gonna inspire a lot of people to take actions to get the same thing you did. So dude, that's everything for me. Unless there's anything else you wanna talk about, maybe where can people find you, Instagram?\n\nI mean, are you bothered about that stuff or not?\n\nI'm like, you can plug in LinkedIn, my name.\n\nYou can find me there. Yeah. That's about it.\n\nTom.\n\nBut but thank you to you too as well, Charlie, and for all the time into the modules.\n\nWell, dude, you you bought the thing, so thank you.\n\nMutually beneficial relationship. George, thank you, brother. I'll, I'll talk to you soon. And, everyone watching this, go and subscribe and like.\n\nAnd if you want similar stuff, George, results wise, click the first thing in the description. It will be explained there. You can click it. If you if you don't wanna click it, it's fine.\n\nRight. Nice one, guys. See you later."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}}, {});
