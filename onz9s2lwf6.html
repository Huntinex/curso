How's it going? Welcome to another client interview. This is the third interview I've done in the last two weeks, so they seem to be just flying at us, which is amazing news. Today, I'm joined by Aurelien, a guy with an awesome name and an awesome agency.\n\nAurelien's been working with us for if I'm not mistaken, mate, it's been since the end of March, so about six months. Yes.\n\nYeah. And in the course of those six months, Aurelien's taken his agency, from zero to ten k a month. So we've literally gone from absolutely nothing so, Aurelien, why don't you just take a second to explain to everybody who you are, what your background is, and what your niche is?\n\nOkay.\n\nSo like Charlie said, my name is Aurelien. Full name, Navara, but you can call me Ray. That's what I see on all of the movies. Yeah.\n\nBut but yeah. So I really started this program from zero.\n\nAnd previous to that, I was in the agency business for a year and a half and really just going nowhere, not knowing what to do, trying out all these different strategies.\n\nNothing really worked.\n\nAnd then I got a message from Jack Roberts, sending me an amazing voice mail that just captivated me, and I knew I had to take the the opportunity to kind of find out more about it. Mhmm. When I was closed, really, it was fantastic. Like, from that point on, I have to say my life completely changed in terms of the agency, in terms of direction, in terms of clarity with what to do with the strategies. It was really just kind of a life bending moment. Amazing.\n\nBut, yeah, from really from young, I've always like, I started pretty early even before agents. Yeah. At sixteen years old of drop shipping. I had a fantastic experience beginning COVID, generating, like, in two weeks' time, ten k, but then lost it all due to supplier issues. So then Mhmm. The agency thing. Yeah.\n\nIt's amazing, man. So you're if I'm not mistaken, you are in the interior designer's niche.\n\nSo you work in the design.\n\nArchitects. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Why did you pick that niche?\n\nSo, really, one like, that two years prior with, before I found the course, I had a few clients, losing them very quickly because the the service delivery was pretty bad, but I still had one client. And now one client was in the interior design niche. And just with social media management, we found a way to generate results for her business and for her her studio. So when I got the course, the the training on kind of finding the niche, I decided to kind of go with interior design.\n\nAlso, what I realized after doing research, there's so many like, there's not even any agencies that kind of operate in that niche. I'm kind of alone here. There's one guy, but it's it's not it's not the best. And all the others provide SEO services that just don't work.\n\nI mean, after all the interviews I do and speak to interior designers, they all have that common problem, but SEO doesn't know. These other things don't work. Yeah. So, so yeah.\n\nYeah. Makes sense, man. That's brilliant. So let's talk about where you were. So, obviously, you know, now you're making ten grand a month.\n\nThis is your first month officially hitting that sort of five figure income, which is phenomenal, man. Should be really proud of that. So you you'd been in the agency space before working with us for about a year and a half. And during that time, you'd basically just been spinning your wheels, never being able to go beyond, like, two clients.\n\nJust Yeah. Like, what was the big problem that you were facing? Like, why couldn't you go beyond that point, do you think? Explain the situation to me.\n\nSo it was like, what I found out, I mean, after doing this training, like, everything was wrong.\n\nI was kind of stuck in my shelf thinking also it was a big ego thing. Like, I didn't wanna get told by anyone. I wanted to teach myself how to do it and stuff, but I was completely lost in terms of a, the structure of the business.\n\nLike, I was hiring already when I had only, like, one client, so that I was even making too much money. Then in terms of getting clients, I was only basing it on referrals. Right? I was pushing for referrals. I tried email marketing.\n\nI didn't even learn it. I just put some people to it, and it just didn't work.\n\nAlso, I wasn't niched out at all, meaning I was just providing, like, a crappy service to all the different niches except interior designers. No one interior designer. But, like, the best way to put it in all the domains of running an agency, I was lost. I was just completely lost, not knowing what to do and running around in circles and not getting anywhere.\n\nOkay. That makes sense. And what was it in the program that made you feel like you were found, if that makes sense? What were the modules?\n\nThat's the reaction I was hoping for, to be honest. But, like, what specifically did you find to be the most useful?\n\nSo I got on the the program. Honestly, the first few videos where, you know, where you say start here, already that just changed everything. It was just paradigm shift after paradigm shift after paradigm shift. So I got a niche.\n\nThe structure was then kind of sorted.\n\nThen in terms of client acquisition, I stumbled upon, Luma Alchemy, love at first sight, honestly, and started that as soon as possible. Knew exactly what to do to get clients even though the first few weeks weren't as successful, but I never had as much engagement with emails that I sent out. Then I start, the imperium approach, which is utilizing Instagram, Facebook, short, snappy messages.\n\nFrom then on, it told me just I can get appointments. It kind of just changed that whole belief system. But getting appointments is hard, and it convinced myself I can get appointments. And just from that training, just from the client acquisition kind of training, like, I broke her a personal record. I had I generated six new appointments in one day, which was crazy.\n\nThat's good. And, and then at the time when I started, there was no mindset module. The mindset module is it should be a course of its own, honestly. It's just it's worth so much.\n\nAnd I saw that you posted a video of the mindset module in your YouTube channel. And to everyone that viewed that video, that's just the the beginning. It's it's nothing compared to what's actually out there. And, the mindset module, like, it just changed everything.\n\nLike, it hotwired my brain to to want more, to generate more, to look for more, to just keep on improving myself. Of course, the journey wasn't just a straight line because I have to say, even though it took me six months to, get to that ten k, I really kind of switched up or switched on after the, after watching the mindset module. And really, the honest truth is, three months back, I was at around, like, two k, three k. And in three months time, I actually got to ten k, I'd say, or generated, like, seven k of extra revenue.\n\nAnd that's really all due to the mindset module, which is that's a huge part as well.\n\nAnd I haven't even finished the program and still on the paid attractions, but there's just so much more Dude, nobody's nobody who started the program has finished it.\n\nThe fun fact for you, we've not got anyone with a one hundred percent completion rate because of how much there is in there.\n\nBut, you know, what so the mindset module is obviously the big the big turning point. And for anyone watching this who's unfamiliar with how we operate in inside of the program, we obviously teach the strategies that Aurelien was discussing earlier. Because you went through the same the sales training and stuff, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nOh, the sales training, Charlie.\n\nThe sales I didn't touch on that, but the sales training so, like, in the lost recalls, I had, lost recalls all converted.\n\nCrazy.\n\nReally?\n\nYeah.\n\nThat's insane, man. That's good. So, like, yeah, you've been through so you obviously have the sales script, the training, the organic stuff. You've got appointments in sales. And it was funny because, obviously, as you mentioned, for the first three months, you had all that stuff.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut it wasn't until you start working on the mindset that you were like, oh, yeah. I'll now go because, you know, the the organic and the sales stuff took you from zero to three or four k. And then the mindset stuff takes you from three or four k to, like, ten, fifteen, twenty k as as you go beyond that. What what specifically in the mindset module was helpful? Was there one or two things that stood out to you that just or was it just as a general vibe, it just improved? What was it, do you think?\n\nSo Tartu, there's a lot in there. I know. But, like, could you can you isolate one or two things, you think, that would have been that basically got you to that ten k mod?\n\nSo, really, it's just I was never aware, first of all, when, like like, characters and, like, beliefs and stuff could change. So that's one big thing, like the whole belief system by you teaching the self transcendence.\n\nThat was a huge shift, but I can become whoever I want. I can achieve whatever I want. It's just a matter of believing the right things. Mhmm.\n\nThat that's one key factor. Also, the action steps. Right now I'm on designing life, the last one, the key action steps to actually kind of continue because I watched the modules. Right? The first three modules.\n\nFantastic. Amazing. Like, I started running. I started going to the gym. I started doing all of that. But then after two weeks, after actually, after a month, I started seeing the oscillations that you speak about.\n\nYeah. And then just you guys down.\n\nOscillations. And then at that point, I was like, oh, no. I'm scared to to kind of go back down to the same level I kind of the same level I started at. But then as the module kind of progressed, you posted more videos. The action steps actually get all of that started kind of just kept me up and set my standards higher in terms of the oscillations.\n\nMhmm. So really, yeah, the belief system realizing oscillations as well. And also that it's normal, but gotta fight it. I I'd say these are the two key steps. I kind of ramble on here, but, Yes.\n\nI'm sure it's useful for everyone.\n\nI think it's, the the mindset module to people who aren't in the program is shrouded in all of this mystery, rightfully so because it's obviously, like, it's some of my best work, which is which I really enjoyed making it, but it Like, we can all tell, Charlie, but, like, on the when I speak because I speak to all the members.\n\nYeah.\n\nEveryone, they ask me or I ask them, what did you think about the mindset module? They all have the same reaction as me. It's just phenomenal. It's absolutely phenomenal.\n\nAnd, honestly, the price of the course, like, the mindset module alone is worth that price. And, obviously, look at me, already kind of a huge return on investment, especially with due to that mindset module. But I don't wanna kind of devalue all the other strategies you speak about because that's the that's really Yeah. Everything.\n\nOne of, you know, one of the things when when Bo and I were building out the course, in the beginning, one of the strategies we had or paradigms we had specifically for is to make each submodule as valuable as the price of the program itself.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo, for example, if we're charging, like, six grand or eight grand or twelve grand for the program, we would want to be able just to sell the sales module, and people be happy to pay just for that. Yeah. So when, like yeah. And then the mindset module and just sell that for that price.\n\nAnd that was that was the level of we were aiming for is, like, if we just took this module standing alone, could we sell it high ticket? And if the answer is no, then it's just not good enough. And the thing about the training, all the videos, I'm still not happy with the mindset module. It's like, I know it's amazing and it kicks ass, but I'm still not content with how I made it and how good it is because if if I think it's as good as it can be, then I'll there'll be no I won't bother to try and improve it.\n\nAnd and we've been doing that for pretty much everything in the program, so with new strategies and stuff we've got coming up. So you've been through the program. You've seen the transformation.\n\nHow do you feel? So knowing that you're now the person that can make six figures and make ten grand a month and knowing that you've gone from, you know, a complete situation of pain and struggle for, like, a year and a half to the point where you're now a a six figure earner, how do how does that make you feel? Because, dude, I remember when I first hit ten k a month, I I couldn't stop smiling, man. But how do you feel? Like, it must be unbelievable.\n\nSo it's hard to describe the feelings at first. Like, when I saw that number because I didn't even the progression, I didn't even see it. And then I thought, wow. We're at ten k.\n\nI was so focused on the work and just grinding, grinding on basically with the course that I kind of lost track of it. When I saw ten k, it was just a big reality check. Like, you've made it. It's possible.\n\nYou can go even further.\n\nAnd after, like, a few days of realizing where we're at, this deeper drive and this deeper kind of level of focus to go even further just hits. And it's just right now, I know I like, I hit the ten k, which I think is one of the hardest challenges. I don't know yet, but so far, one of the hardest challenges of my life, which I've accomplished.\n\nLike and hitting the twenty, twenty k or even fifty k just feels so close. I know exactly how to get there. I know it's true. I have a better mindset, a better knowledge to get to that point. So I just I'm really in the state of mind, and that's really what the ten k really just the state of mind of pure focus and pure motivation to go even further because now I know I can do it.\n\nThat's really good. Cause most people get there and get lazy.\n\nI think I think the best piece of advice I'd give you is skip twenty, skip thirty, just go straight for fifty.\n\nBecause, like, the natural seriously, because, like, the natural progression the natural progression for everyone who gets to ten k is, like, alright. I'm now gonna get to twenty.\n\nBut you know now, like, all you've got to do to get to twenty is do what you've already done again.\n\nYeah.\n\nRight? And you can do that, but you can't do what you've done again five times to get to fifty k because then you have to start learning how to manage your time and hire a team.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut, like, ten to twenty is not hard. But ten to fifty is where another level of challenge comes in. But if you just try and go for twenty, man, you'll get it, and then you'll be like, alright. I'll go for thirty.\n\nAnd then you get stuck in this, like, business growth shouldn't be linear. It shouldn't be like, alright. I'm gonna get to ten ten, and then I'm gonna get to twenty five, and then I'm gonna get to fifty. You should go, like, ten, fifty, a hundred, three hundred, five hundred, a million.\n\nThat's the trajectory that we're on. And it's like, a lot of people limit themselves by you know, they look at ten k and they think that's a lot of money. So then they think, well, if I just double that, then I've I've doubled a lot of money. But it's like Yeah.\n\nYou know? But but it's a big shift. So what So you wanna get to that that next level.\n\nYou're because if I'm not mistaken, you're gonna really start to put fire on the gas now. Gas on the fire. Sorry. So you're gonna start doing ads.\n\nWhat are the next steps for you as a business owner?\n\nThe next steps really it's I serve my content strategy. So I I film, like, thirty videos already, to get started on Monday. I think it's kind of a bit of a pain avoidance to not get it started today.\n\nMonday? Dude, that's like a hundred hours away, man. Why are you wearing the Monday?\n\nI'll try and do it as soon as possible.\n\nYou know, it's like one one thing I've always noticed with, I'll do it tomorrow. It's like, if you rephrase that to say, like, I'll do it in twenty four hours, then you start to think why. Like, if you say if you like if you put a date, like, a specific day on when you're gonna do something next, it creates this justification. But when you when you figure out how many hours you're actually waiting and then maybe how many minutes you're actually waiting, it's like I don't know. Let's say it's, like, a hundred hours, which is, like, I don't know, like, sort of, six thousand minutes or something like that, then you're like, why am I waiting six thousand minutes to do something that I could just do right now and it would take me ten minutes? But any anyway, anyway, carry on.\n\nSo you start a new content strategy in six thousand hours I'm gonna start it today.\n\nSix thousand minutes.\n\nI'm gonna start it today.\n\nAnd yeah. And then on Monday, because I'm still doing the lead page right before this call, I was do on, focusing on the lead page, creating the lead page. The ads, should be ready to get started. So as soon as the lead page is up, we're gonna start the the paid attraction, paid attraction. So use it utilizing Facebook ads, possibly Instagram ads, to attract, prospects for appointments.\n\nThen for Loom, like, the the methods that have worked the best for me to get to that ten k, we're planning on doubling it. So for or even more than doubling it. So currently, we're sending fifty emails a day, fifty emails, Loom emails a day, planning to take that to two hundred.\n\nAnd also in the process, optimize the Loom scripts, optimize the videos, optimize further because I think I'm still still not there in terms of KPIs, but it's still generating me a lot.\n\nYeah.\n\nHow many clients do you need to get to fifty k a month? Like, twenty five? How many clients?\n\nSo right now, to get to that ten k, what we did is kind of I took your word for it. Kinda do anything to get to that ten k. So I did kind of reduce their prices to a thousand USD per month with advertising budgets.\n\nBut then what what I've planned out is two twenty k, ten to twenty k to kind of possibly double that amount. So proposed two thousand with advertising budgets. Mhmm. Then to get to fifty k, like, maybe bring it up to three thousand.\n\nLike, I don't know what to do with the pricing yet, but I don't know need, like sixty clients.\n\nYou'd probably need, like let's say you were charging two k and bringing back two k, and then the client pays for out of spend separately. You'd need twenty five clients. And if your sales conversion rate on that, if even if it was, like, ten percent, then you'd only need two hundred and fifty meetings.\n\nSo then you just kinda just figure out how can you get two hundred and fifty meetings, and then you just engineer that back. Like, let's say you've got, like, a one percent appointment booking rate. You just send Yeah. Yeah. You just send twenty five thousand email.\n\nYeah.\n\nLike, if if you look at it like that, like, if you if you've got a ten percent sales conversion rate and a one percent appointment booking rate, then you're literally twenty five thousand emails away from fifty k a month.\n\nThat's in the mindset modules.\n\nPeople don't see it like that, though. It's like Yeah. It's not people, like, wanna optimize their KPIs and have really efficient systems, but but people, like, who wanna get to ten grand a month. Let's say you're all full at sales and have a ten percent conversion. Right? You close more than ten.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know? And you on on cold calls, you know, let's say that you make a hundred cold calls to book a meeting because you're not that efficient at cold calling. Right? Then it's like, okay.\n\nWell, how many, like, calls do you need to get ten clients to get to ten k a month? A hundred calls. Alright. Then, like, what's what what hundred is one percent of what?\n\nThen you just figure that out, and it just turns out that you're literally just like what even is that?\n\nTen thousand cold calls away from ten k a month?\n\nYeah.\n\nWhich is a pretty a lot of cold calls, but, like, if you think about that logically, if you make, you know, enough calls, you the people don't see it like that. But It's a good idea.\n\nIt it gives it that kind of, like, a lot of clarity. You know what you have to do to get there. Maybe the numbers might be a bit, like, statistically, they might be a bit off, but it is the best way to kind of see it.\n\nWell, if you if you did cold calling every day for ninety days and you made a hundred and eleven cold calls a day Yeah. With a one percent appointment booking rate and a ten percent sales conversion rate, you get to ten k a month.\n\nPeople don't realize it, man. They're just like they're literally a hundred cold calls a day away from ten k a month in three months. You can make more than the doctor trains for in seven years in ninety days just by doing by picking up a phone a hundred times and telling people what you do. But, you know, I don't know, man. People are mad. But either way, man, so you've got so you you're here now. You've gone from zero to about roughly zero to ten k a month in the course of six months.\n\nI'll I'll you just you can say six months, but I'd say three months, honestly, because the the first three months of me being in the course, I I don't know. I wasn't doing what I was it was loads of pain avoidance. Like, it was almost ninety percent pain avoidance. Because the thing is I knew it worked.\n\nI knew it worked. Everyone was telling me it works. But then it was just this huge thing stopping me back. And before the mindset module and that's why with all the new members, I tell them, make sure to kind of watch the mindset module still kind of at the beginning while learning the Loom because at my stage, like, I got the strategies down for client acquisition, but the main problem as well was the mindset.\n\nIt was kind of Yeah. The belief system. It was all of that. And, honestly, like, I refer back to these videos every, like, every two weeks.\n\nAt least I look at one.\n\nYeah. Designing the journal right now as well.\n\nAnd it's just for me, it's mainly that. And one huge thing that stopped from the coaching calls.\n\nNo. It's actually from the mindset video. You you highlighted when you started, it's like eighty percent mindset and then, like, I think twenty percent, strategies and stuff. I agree with that. Like, for me, it was exactly the case. Maybe for others, they already have the mindset down, but and the thing is at the beginning, I thought I had it down. Like, I thought I was the I had an amazing mindset and stuff, but I just didn't.\n\nYeah. I think a lot of people do. It's it's a massive do you know what I've it's it's a weird sort of paradox non binary thing because if you think, like it's it's what I was saying earlier about the videos, but, like, a lot of people think if they've done mindset training, they've got a good mindset.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut if you think you've got a good mindset, that's a bad mindset.\n\nYeah.\n\nDoes that make sense? Because, like, if you think that Does If you think your mind because your mindset right now is produces the result you get. So if my mindset, for example, can make me two hundred or three hundred grand a month, but I shouldn't label it as good or bad. I should label it as facilitate like, as as something that can facilitate the level I'm at.\n\nSo it's like, is my mindset good or bad? It it's only ever relative to my goals. So right now, my mindset is bad because I wanna get to eight figures. And if I had the mindset for eight figures in enough time, I'd be there.\n\nSo I think it's it's easy to fall into that trap. Like, you said at the beginning where you think like, oh, but I'm super motivated, and I'm disciplined, and I read a lot. It's like, yeah. But it's it's those paradigm shifts that you you don't have.\n\nAnd if you thought like that, then you wouldn't have the right paradigm anyway.\n\nBut, man, I'm so happy for you, and, you know, it makes me really excited and happy to know that you're not stopping either, and you're just gonna keep going. So what, there's one thing I like to get my lovely students who have been successful at the end to to try and sell the program to the people watching. So if you were Easy.\n\nIf if you were a, if you were watching this video and you were thinking about booking a call with Imperium or you were on the fence deciding whether to join, what advice would you give to yourself knowing what you know now?\n\nI'm thinking.\n\nTry and put it in three words.\n\nTrust your guts, probably.\n\nTrust yourself.\n\nBecause when I was on the call, the thing is that, like, there's so much pain involved from the last last almost year and a half of just not not getting anywhere. And my motivation, like, I dropped out of uni, to kind of pursue this. It was going nowhere. Right? And obviously, parents, were it's a big kind of change dropping out of uni. And then on the call, it was like it felt like all my problems were gonna go away, but it felt too good to be true. And I was very doubtful.\n\nAnd if any of you guys are on a call with Charlie, Jack, or more, don't doubt yourself. This is the right way to go. This is if you want an agency, a a thriving agency, and you're willing to put the work, this is probably the best course out there. I don't know if I'm allowed to mention names, but looking at all the people's okay.\n\nI mean, the I because the thing is I don't know which courses you've been through before, and it's technically not me slaying anyone. So We all know Imaan's course.\n\nWe all know his course.\n\nAll I'd heard about his scores, and I I got it as well, is about it's shit. And from what I've seen, it's it's absolute crap compared to this. Like, just the the just the the the starter videos, possibly from this course here is better than the whole course of demands.\n\nLike, it's just this is the best thing on the market. I know this for a fact and, like, I'm I'm one of the kind of the proof here, but this works.\n\nThis fucking works.\n\nAppreciate it, mate.\n\nEveryone else. Honestly, everyone else as well, but kind of succeeded into the group. You're you're not even mentioning everyone. That's the thing.\n\nThere's so many people thing, dude.\n\nThere's so many people that Yeah. There's so many people like you who have gone from zero to ten or from from five to twenty or to forty to fifty. But I asked them if they wanna be interviewed, and they're like, no. I'd rather just keep it low key. And because, you know, obviously, to come on a on on someone's YouTube channel and talk about how much money you're making and build story, it's not everyone wants to talk about that.\n\nAnd, you know, so there's a lot of people that we've got, I think, now probably, like, thirteen or fifteen or so interviews like this, but I could make another fifteen with people, but they just they don't well, they're not comfortable, and that's fine. But then generally speaking, fifteen interviews of people who have added six multi six there's your answer, guys.\n\nLike, everyone in this group is succeeding. Before as well, before I went on a call, I asked Jack. I was like, please send me the contacts of, like, five or ten people in this group already. She gave me the contacts without hiding anything.\n\nJust gave me the contacts, contacted them on LinkedIn. All of them had the same answer as me. All of them, this is fantastic. If you wanna take grow your agency, if you wanna take it seriously, get this course.\n\nAnd the price tag just you don't even think about the price tag anymore because it is worth every single penny and a hundred times more. So if you don't have this course and you're looking to get an agent, yeah, I have no clue what you're doing. You're gonna be lost, I believe, for years and years and years.\n\nYep.\n\nIt's amazing.\n\nAlright, man. Well, I I think we'll wrap it up early, and I think that's been, I mean, for me, I'll share this with the team as well. It's always, it's always I'm not surprised that you've got such good results, but I'm always I always find it slightly unbelievable that we can someone can go through content that we've made and then come out on the other end six months later with a hundred grand a year business, it's like, okay. Like, I know it's happens and it's easy to do it because the program is good, but it also sometimes blows my mind that you've got the commitment and, you know, the work ethic and people who can actually just sit down and do it because it's rare to find that one.\n\nSo listen. We'll call it here. Anyone watching, book a bloody call. I'm telling you now.\n\nAnd, and no doubt we'll see a again on the channel in a couple of months or maybe a year.\n\nGreat. Fantastic. Cheers, man.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/onz9s2lwf6?autoplay=0&wmode=transparent&wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

How's it going? Welcome to another client interview. This is the third interview I've done in the last two weeks, so they seem to be just flying at us, which is amazing news. Today, I'm joined by Aurelien, a guy with an awesome name and an awesome agency.\n\nAurelien's been working with us for if I'm not mistaken, mate, it's been since the end of March, so about six months. Yes.\n\nYeah. And in the course of those six months, Aurelien's taken his agency, from zero to ten k a month. So we've literally gone from absolutely nothing so, Aurelien, why don't you just take a second to explain to everybody who you are, what your background is, and what your niche is?\n\nOkay.\n\nSo like Charlie said, my name is Aurelien. Full name, Navara, but you can call me Ray. That's what I see on all of the movies. Yeah.\n\nBut but yeah. So I really started this program from zero.\n\nAnd previous to that, I was in the agency business for a year and a half and really just going nowhere, not knowing what to do, trying out all these different strategies.\n\nNothing really worked.\n\nAnd then I got a message from Jack Roberts, sending me an amazing voice mail that just captivated me, and I knew I had to take the the opportunity to kind of find out more about it. Mhmm. When I was closed, really, it was fantastic. Like, from that point on, I have to say my life completely changed in terms of the agency, in terms of direction, in terms of clarity with what to do with the strategies. It was really just kind of a life bending moment. Amazing.\n\nBut, yeah, from really from young, I've always like, I started pretty early even before agents. Yeah. At sixteen years old of drop shipping. I had a fantastic experience beginning COVID, generating, like, in two weeks' time, ten k, but then lost it all due to supplier issues. So then Mhmm. The agency thing. Yeah.\n\nIt's amazing, man. So you're if I'm not mistaken, you are in the interior designer's niche.\n\nSo you work in the design.\n\nArchitects. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Why did you pick that niche?\n\nSo, really, one like, that two years prior with, before I found the course, I had a few clients, losing them very quickly because the the service delivery was pretty bad, but I still had one client. And now one client was in the interior design niche. And just with social media management, we found a way to generate results for her business and for her her studio. So when I got the course, the the training on kind of finding the niche, I decided to kind of go with interior design.\n\nAlso, what I realized after doing research, there's so many like, there's not even any agencies that kind of operate in that niche. I'm kind of alone here. There's one guy, but it's it's not it's not the best. And all the others provide SEO services that just don't work.\n\nI mean, after all the interviews I do and speak to interior designers, they all have that common problem, but SEO doesn't know. These other things don't work. Yeah. So, so yeah.\n\nYeah. Makes sense, man. That's brilliant. So let's talk about where you were. So, obviously, you know, now you're making ten grand a month.\n\nThis is your first month officially hitting that sort of five figure income, which is phenomenal, man. Should be really proud of that. So you you'd been in the agency space before working with us for about a year and a half. And during that time, you'd basically just been spinning your wheels, never being able to go beyond, like, two clients.\n\nJust Yeah. Like, what was the big problem that you were facing? Like, why couldn't you go beyond that point, do you think? Explain the situation to me.\n\nSo it was like, what I found out, I mean, after doing this training, like, everything was wrong.\n\nI was kind of stuck in my shelf thinking also it was a big ego thing. Like, I didn't wanna get told by anyone. I wanted to teach myself how to do it and stuff, but I was completely lost in terms of a, the structure of the business.\n\nLike, I was hiring already when I had only, like, one client, so that I was even making too much money. Then in terms of getting clients, I was only basing it on referrals. Right? I was pushing for referrals. I tried email marketing.\n\nI didn't even learn it. I just put some people to it, and it just didn't work.\n\nAlso, I wasn't niched out at all, meaning I was just providing, like, a crappy service to all the different niches except interior designers. No one interior designer. But, like, the best way to put it in all the domains of running an agency, I was lost. I was just completely lost, not knowing what to do and running around in circles and not getting anywhere.\n\nOkay. That makes sense. And what was it in the program that made you feel like you were found, if that makes sense? What were the modules?\n\nThat's the reaction I was hoping for, to be honest. But, like, what specifically did you find to be the most useful?\n\nSo I got on the the program. Honestly, the first few videos where, you know, where you say start here, already that just changed everything. It was just paradigm shift after paradigm shift after paradigm shift. So I got a niche.\n\nThe structure was then kind of sorted.\n\nThen in terms of client acquisition, I stumbled upon, Luma Alchemy, love at first sight, honestly, and started that as soon as possible. Knew exactly what to do to get clients even though the first few weeks weren't as successful, but I never had as much engagement with emails that I sent out. Then I start, the imperium approach, which is utilizing Instagram, Facebook, short, snappy messages.\n\nFrom then on, it told me just I can get appointments. It kind of just changed that whole belief system. But getting appointments is hard, and it convinced myself I can get appointments. And just from that training, just from the client acquisition kind of training, like, I broke her a personal record. I had I generated six new appointments in one day, which was crazy.\n\nThat's good. And, and then at the time when I started, there was no mindset module. The mindset module is it should be a course of its own, honestly. It's just it's worth so much.\n\nAnd I saw that you posted a video of the mindset module in your YouTube channel. And to everyone that viewed that video, that's just the the beginning. It's it's nothing compared to what's actually out there. And, the mindset module, like, it just changed everything.\n\nLike, it hotwired my brain to to want more, to generate more, to look for more, to just keep on improving myself. Of course, the journey wasn't just a straight line because I have to say, even though it took me six months to, get to that ten k, I really kind of switched up or switched on after the, after watching the mindset module. And really, the honest truth is, three months back, I was at around, like, two k, three k. And in three months time, I actually got to ten k, I'd say, or generated, like, seven k of extra revenue.\n\nAnd that's really all due to the mindset module, which is that's a huge part as well.\n\nAnd I haven't even finished the program and still on the paid attractions, but there's just so much more Dude, nobody's nobody who started the program has finished it.\n\nThe fun fact for you, we've not got anyone with a one hundred percent completion rate because of how much there is in there.\n\nBut, you know, what so the mindset module is obviously the big the big turning point. And for anyone watching this who's unfamiliar with how we operate in inside of the program, we obviously teach the strategies that Aurelien was discussing earlier. Because you went through the same the sales training and stuff, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nOh, the sales training, Charlie.\n\nThe sales I didn't touch on that, but the sales training so, like, in the lost recalls, I had, lost recalls all converted.\n\nCrazy.\n\nReally?\n\nYeah.\n\nThat's insane, man. That's good. So, like, yeah, you've been through so you obviously have the sales script, the training, the organic stuff. You've got appointments in sales. And it was funny because, obviously, as you mentioned, for the first three months, you had all that stuff.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut it wasn't until you start working on the mindset that you were like, oh, yeah. I'll now go because, you know, the the organic and the sales stuff took you from zero to three or four k. And then the mindset stuff takes you from three or four k to, like, ten, fifteen, twenty k as as you go beyond that. What what specifically in the mindset module was helpful? Was there one or two things that stood out to you that just or was it just as a general vibe, it just improved? What was it, do you think?\n\nSo Tartu, there's a lot in there. I know. But, like, could you can you isolate one or two things, you think, that would have been that basically got you to that ten k mod?\n\nSo, really, it's just I was never aware, first of all, when, like like, characters and, like, beliefs and stuff could change. So that's one big thing, like the whole belief system by you teaching the self transcendence.\n\nThat was a huge shift, but I can become whoever I want. I can achieve whatever I want. It's just a matter of believing the right things. Mhmm.\n\nThat that's one key factor. Also, the action steps. Right now I'm on designing life, the last one, the key action steps to actually kind of continue because I watched the modules. Right? The first three modules.\n\nFantastic. Amazing. Like, I started running. I started going to the gym. I started doing all of that. But then after two weeks, after actually, after a month, I started seeing the oscillations that you speak about.\n\nYeah. And then just you guys down.\n\nOscillations. And then at that point, I was like, oh, no. I'm scared to to kind of go back down to the same level I kind of the same level I started at. But then as the module kind of progressed, you posted more videos. The action steps actually get all of that started kind of just kept me up and set my standards higher in terms of the oscillations.\n\nMhmm. So really, yeah, the belief system realizing oscillations as well. And also that it's normal, but gotta fight it. I I'd say these are the two key steps. I kind of ramble on here, but, Yes.\n\nI'm sure it's useful for everyone.\n\nI think it's, the the mindset module to people who aren't in the program is shrouded in all of this mystery, rightfully so because it's obviously, like, it's some of my best work, which is which I really enjoyed making it, but it Like, we can all tell, Charlie, but, like, on the when I speak because I speak to all the members.\n\nYeah.\n\nEveryone, they ask me or I ask them, what did you think about the mindset module? They all have the same reaction as me. It's just phenomenal. It's absolutely phenomenal.\n\nAnd, honestly, the price of the course, like, the mindset module alone is worth that price. And, obviously, look at me, already kind of a huge return on investment, especially with due to that mindset module. But I don't wanna kind of devalue all the other strategies you speak about because that's the that's really Yeah. Everything.\n\nOne of, you know, one of the things when when Bo and I were building out the course, in the beginning, one of the strategies we had or paradigms we had specifically for is to make each submodule as valuable as the price of the program itself.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo, for example, if we're charging, like, six grand or eight grand or twelve grand for the program, we would want to be able just to sell the sales module, and people be happy to pay just for that. Yeah. So when, like yeah. And then the mindset module and just sell that for that price.\n\nAnd that was that was the level of we were aiming for is, like, if we just took this module standing alone, could we sell it high ticket? And if the answer is no, then it's just not good enough. And the thing about the training, all the videos, I'm still not happy with the mindset module. It's like, I know it's amazing and it kicks ass, but I'm still not content with how I made it and how good it is because if if I think it's as good as it can be, then I'll there'll be no I won't bother to try and improve it.\n\nAnd and we've been doing that for pretty much everything in the program, so with new strategies and stuff we've got coming up. So you've been through the program. You've seen the transformation.\n\nHow do you feel? So knowing that you're now the person that can make six figures and make ten grand a month and knowing that you've gone from, you know, a complete situation of pain and struggle for, like, a year and a half to the point where you're now a a six figure earner, how do how does that make you feel? Because, dude, I remember when I first hit ten k a month, I I couldn't stop smiling, man. But how do you feel? Like, it must be unbelievable.\n\nSo it's hard to describe the feelings at first. Like, when I saw that number because I didn't even the progression, I didn't even see it. And then I thought, wow. We're at ten k.\n\nI was so focused on the work and just grinding, grinding on basically with the course that I kind of lost track of it. When I saw ten k, it was just a big reality check. Like, you've made it. It's possible.\n\nYou can go even further.\n\nAnd after, like, a few days of realizing where we're at, this deeper drive and this deeper kind of level of focus to go even further just hits. And it's just right now, I know I like, I hit the ten k, which I think is one of the hardest challenges. I don't know yet, but so far, one of the hardest challenges of my life, which I've accomplished.\n\nLike and hitting the twenty, twenty k or even fifty k just feels so close. I know exactly how to get there. I know it's true. I have a better mindset, a better knowledge to get to that point. So I just I'm really in the state of mind, and that's really what the ten k really just the state of mind of pure focus and pure motivation to go even further because now I know I can do it.\n\nThat's really good. Cause most people get there and get lazy.\n\nI think I think the best piece of advice I'd give you is skip twenty, skip thirty, just go straight for fifty.\n\nBecause, like, the natural seriously, because, like, the natural progression the natural progression for everyone who gets to ten k is, like, alright. I'm now gonna get to twenty.\n\nBut you know now, like, all you've got to do to get to twenty is do what you've already done again.\n\nYeah.\n\nRight? And you can do that, but you can't do what you've done again five times to get to fifty k because then you have to start learning how to manage your time and hire a team.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut, like, ten to twenty is not hard. But ten to fifty is where another level of challenge comes in. But if you just try and go for twenty, man, you'll get it, and then you'll be like, alright. I'll go for thirty.\n\nAnd then you get stuck in this, like, business growth shouldn't be linear. It shouldn't be like, alright. I'm gonna get to ten ten, and then I'm gonna get to twenty five, and then I'm gonna get to fifty. You should go, like, ten, fifty, a hundred, three hundred, five hundred, a million.\n\nThat's the trajectory that we're on. And it's like, a lot of people limit themselves by you know, they look at ten k and they think that's a lot of money. So then they think, well, if I just double that, then I've I've doubled a lot of money. But it's like Yeah.\n\nYou know? But but it's a big shift. So what So you wanna get to that that next level.\n\nYou're because if I'm not mistaken, you're gonna really start to put fire on the gas now. Gas on the fire. Sorry. So you're gonna start doing ads.\n\nWhat are the next steps for you as a business owner?\n\nThe next steps really it's I serve my content strategy. So I I film, like, thirty videos already, to get started on Monday. I think it's kind of a bit of a pain avoidance to not get it started today.\n\nMonday? Dude, that's like a hundred hours away, man. Why are you wearing the Monday?\n\nI'll try and do it as soon as possible.\n\nYou know, it's like one one thing I've always noticed with, I'll do it tomorrow. It's like, if you rephrase that to say, like, I'll do it in twenty four hours, then you start to think why. Like, if you say if you like if you put a date, like, a specific day on when you're gonna do something next, it creates this justification. But when you when you figure out how many hours you're actually waiting and then maybe how many minutes you're actually waiting, it's like I don't know. Let's say it's, like, a hundred hours, which is, like, I don't know, like, sort of, six thousand minutes or something like that, then you're like, why am I waiting six thousand minutes to do something that I could just do right now and it would take me ten minutes? But any anyway, anyway, carry on.\n\nSo you start a new content strategy in six thousand hours I'm gonna start it today.\n\nSix thousand minutes.\n\nI'm gonna start it today.\n\nAnd yeah. And then on Monday, because I'm still doing the lead page right before this call, I was do on, focusing on the lead page, creating the lead page. The ads, should be ready to get started. So as soon as the lead page is up, we're gonna start the the paid attraction, paid attraction. So use it utilizing Facebook ads, possibly Instagram ads, to attract, prospects for appointments.\n\nThen for Loom, like, the the methods that have worked the best for me to get to that ten k, we're planning on doubling it. So for or even more than doubling it. So currently, we're sending fifty emails a day, fifty emails, Loom emails a day, planning to take that to two hundred.\n\nAnd also in the process, optimize the Loom scripts, optimize the videos, optimize further because I think I'm still still not there in terms of KPIs, but it's still generating me a lot.\n\nYeah.\n\nHow many clients do you need to get to fifty k a month? Like, twenty five? How many clients?\n\nSo right now, to get to that ten k, what we did is kind of I took your word for it. Kinda do anything to get to that ten k. So I did kind of reduce their prices to a thousand USD per month with advertising budgets.\n\nBut then what what I've planned out is two twenty k, ten to twenty k to kind of possibly double that amount. So proposed two thousand with advertising budgets. Mhmm. Then to get to fifty k, like, maybe bring it up to three thousand.\n\nLike, I don't know what to do with the pricing yet, but I don't know need, like sixty clients.\n\nYou'd probably need, like let's say you were charging two k and bringing back two k, and then the client pays for out of spend separately. You'd need twenty five clients. And if your sales conversion rate on that, if even if it was, like, ten percent, then you'd only need two hundred and fifty meetings.\n\nSo then you just kinda just figure out how can you get two hundred and fifty meetings, and then you just engineer that back. Like, let's say you've got, like, a one percent appointment booking rate. You just send Yeah. Yeah. You just send twenty five thousand email.\n\nYeah.\n\nLike, if if you look at it like that, like, if you if you've got a ten percent sales conversion rate and a one percent appointment booking rate, then you're literally twenty five thousand emails away from fifty k a month.\n\nThat's in the mindset modules.\n\nPeople don't see it like that, though. It's like Yeah. It's not people, like, wanna optimize their KPIs and have really efficient systems, but but people, like, who wanna get to ten grand a month. Let's say you're all full at sales and have a ten percent conversion. Right? You close more than ten.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know? And you on on cold calls, you know, let's say that you make a hundred cold calls to book a meeting because you're not that efficient at cold calling. Right? Then it's like, okay.\n\nWell, how many, like, calls do you need to get ten clients to get to ten k a month? A hundred calls. Alright. Then, like, what's what what hundred is one percent of what?\n\nThen you just figure that out, and it just turns out that you're literally just like what even is that?\n\nTen thousand cold calls away from ten k a month?\n\nYeah.\n\nWhich is a pretty a lot of cold calls, but, like, if you think about that logically, if you make, you know, enough calls, you the people don't see it like that. But It's a good idea.\n\nIt it gives it that kind of, like, a lot of clarity. You know what you have to do to get there. Maybe the numbers might be a bit, like, statistically, they might be a bit off, but it is the best way to kind of see it.\n\nWell, if you if you did cold calling every day for ninety days and you made a hundred and eleven cold calls a day Yeah. With a one percent appointment booking rate and a ten percent sales conversion rate, you get to ten k a month.\n\nPeople don't realize it, man. They're just like they're literally a hundred cold calls a day away from ten k a month in three months. You can make more than the doctor trains for in seven years in ninety days just by doing by picking up a phone a hundred times and telling people what you do. But, you know, I don't know, man. People are mad. But either way, man, so you've got so you you're here now. You've gone from zero to about roughly zero to ten k a month in the course of six months.\n\nI'll I'll you just you can say six months, but I'd say three months, honestly, because the the first three months of me being in the course, I I don't know. I wasn't doing what I was it was loads of pain avoidance. Like, it was almost ninety percent pain avoidance. Because the thing is I knew it worked.\n\nI knew it worked. Everyone was telling me it works. But then it was just this huge thing stopping me back. And before the mindset module and that's why with all the new members, I tell them, make sure to kind of watch the mindset module still kind of at the beginning while learning the Loom because at my stage, like, I got the strategies down for client acquisition, but the main problem as well was the mindset.\n\nIt was kind of Yeah. The belief system. It was all of that. And, honestly, like, I refer back to these videos every, like, every two weeks.\n\nAt least I look at one.\n\nYeah. Designing the journal right now as well.\n\nAnd it's just for me, it's mainly that. And one huge thing that stopped from the coaching calls.\n\nNo. It's actually from the mindset video. You you highlighted when you started, it's like eighty percent mindset and then, like, I think twenty percent, strategies and stuff. I agree with that. Like, for me, it was exactly the case. Maybe for others, they already have the mindset down, but and the thing is at the beginning, I thought I had it down. Like, I thought I was the I had an amazing mindset and stuff, but I just didn't.\n\nYeah. I think a lot of people do. It's it's a massive do you know what I've it's it's a weird sort of paradox non binary thing because if you think, like it's it's what I was saying earlier about the videos, but, like, a lot of people think if they've done mindset training, they've got a good mindset.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut if you think you've got a good mindset, that's a bad mindset.\n\nYeah.\n\nDoes that make sense? Because, like, if you think that Does If you think your mind because your mindset right now is produces the result you get. So if my mindset, for example, can make me two hundred or three hundred grand a month, but I shouldn't label it as good or bad. I should label it as facilitate like, as as something that can facilitate the level I'm at.\n\nSo it's like, is my mindset good or bad? It it's only ever relative to my goals. So right now, my mindset is bad because I wanna get to eight figures. And if I had the mindset for eight figures in enough time, I'd be there.\n\nSo I think it's it's easy to fall into that trap. Like, you said at the beginning where you think like, oh, but I'm super motivated, and I'm disciplined, and I read a lot. It's like, yeah. But it's it's those paradigm shifts that you you don't have.\n\nAnd if you thought like that, then you wouldn't have the right paradigm anyway.\n\nBut, man, I'm so happy for you, and, you know, it makes me really excited and happy to know that you're not stopping either, and you're just gonna keep going. So what, there's one thing I like to get my lovely students who have been successful at the end to to try and sell the program to the people watching. So if you were Easy.\n\nIf if you were a, if you were watching this video and you were thinking about booking a call with Imperium or you were on the fence deciding whether to join, what advice would you give to yourself knowing what you know now?\n\nI'm thinking.\n\nTry and put it in three words.\n\nTrust your guts, probably.\n\nTrust yourself.\n\nBecause when I was on the call, the thing is that, like, there's so much pain involved from the last last almost year and a half of just not not getting anywhere. And my motivation, like, I dropped out of uni, to kind of pursue this. It was going nowhere. Right? And obviously, parents, were it's a big kind of change dropping out of uni. And then on the call, it was like it felt like all my problems were gonna go away, but it felt too good to be true. And I was very doubtful.\n\nAnd if any of you guys are on a call with Charlie, Jack, or more, don't doubt yourself. This is the right way to go. This is if you want an agency, a a thriving agency, and you're willing to put the work, this is probably the best course out there. I don't know if I'm allowed to mention names, but looking at all the people's okay.\n\nI mean, the I because the thing is I don't know which courses you've been through before, and it's technically not me slaying anyone. So We all know Imaan's course.\n\nWe all know his course.\n\nAll I'd heard about his scores, and I I got it as well, is about it's shit. And from what I've seen, it's it's absolute crap compared to this. Like, just the the just the the the starter videos, possibly from this course here is better than the whole course of demands.\n\nLike, it's just this is the best thing on the market. I know this for a fact and, like, I'm I'm one of the kind of the proof here, but this works.\n\nThis fucking works.\n\nAppreciate it, mate.\n\nEveryone else. Honestly, everyone else as well, but kind of succeeded into the group. You're you're not even mentioning everyone. That's the thing.\n\nThere's so many people thing, dude.\n\nThere's so many people that Yeah. There's so many people like you who have gone from zero to ten or from from five to twenty or to forty to fifty. But I asked them if they wanna be interviewed, and they're like, no. I'd rather just keep it low key. And because, you know, obviously, to come on a on on someone's YouTube channel and talk about how much money you're making and build story, it's not everyone wants to talk about that.\n\nAnd, you know, so there's a lot of people that we've got, I think, now probably, like, thirteen or fifteen or so interviews like this, but I could make another fifteen with people, but they just they don't well, they're not comfortable, and that's fine. But then generally speaking, fifteen interviews of people who have added six multi six there's your answer, guys.\n\nLike, everyone in this group is succeeding. Before as well, before I went on a call, I asked Jack. I was like, please send me the contacts of, like, five or ten people in this group already. She gave me the contacts without hiding anything.\n\nJust gave me the contacts, contacted them on LinkedIn. All of them had the same answer as me. All of them, this is fantastic. If you wanna take grow your agency, if you wanna take it seriously, get this course.\n\nAnd the price tag just you don't even think about the price tag anymore because it is worth every single penny and a hundred times more. So if you don't have this course and you're looking to get an agent, yeah, I have no clue what you're doing. You're gonna be lost, I believe, for years and years and years.\n\nYep.\n\nIt's amazing.\n\nAlright, man. Well, I I think we'll wrap it up early, and I think that's been, I mean, for me, I'll share this with the team as well. It's always, it's always I'm not surprised that you've got such good results, but I'm always I always find it slightly unbelievable that we can someone can go through content that we've made and then come out on the other end six months later with a hundred grand a year business, it's like, okay. Like, I know it's happens and it's easy to do it because the program is good, but it also sometimes blows my mind that you've got the commitment and, you know, the work ethic and people who can actually just sit down and do it because it's rare to find that one.\n\nSo listen. We'll call it here. Anyone watching, book a bloody call. I'm telling you now.\n\nAnd, and no doubt we'll see a again on the channel in a couple of months or maybe a year.\n\nGreat. Fantastic. Cheers, man."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}}, {});
