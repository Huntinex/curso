Hello, everyone, to watching this client interview. You are with Nour here. I run the operation side of Easy Grow.\n\nAnd today, I am joined by, one of our clients called Alex who has done really, really well with the program. And, in this interview, we're just gonna share, pretty much his story and his success with us. So, Alex, good to have you here. We've already spoken just before, you know, the recording started.\n\nBut, yeah, if you can give, like, an intro to who you are, what your agency does, and all that good jazz, it'd be great for the people to have a better understanding of you and your business.\n\nSure. Yeah. Thanks, Noor. Yeah. So I before I go on to the online space, I had my own brick and mortar, brick and mortar location where we printed custom T shirts, custom hats.\n\nSo if you look at Norris hoodie, we can make hoodies like that.\n\nAnd then six years into the pros so about a year ago, I found out about the online space. I actually signed up for a course, and it told me so so I can scale my brick and mortar location. And then he told me that I shouldn't be working with the brick and mortar and said I should just teach other people how to do marketing. So then I thought about that for a little bit.\n\nI joined other coaching programs to see if I can figure out how to set up a marketing agency. But a lot of the other marketing programs, there's not a lot of, like, a through a to z, like, setup. So then in August of last year, I joined Easy Grow, which is Charlie Morgan's program, but I couldn't really start my agency until September. And then for September to January, and January is the first time we hit forty, fifty thousand in one month.\n\nSo the growth has been really quick, but I would say it wasn't easy. It It was kinda painful, and I think it's because we had all the skills that stacked up over the years, and it kind of just I just moved vehicles into a better vehicle. Yeah. And that was the I'd say that's probably the reason of it.\n\nBut I think Easy Grow also has all the tools you need in one place. So you'd have to, like, search on YouTube, spend hours. So when you buy a program like Easy Grow, it kinda cuts your learning time by so you basically add five years to your life, five years of experience into your head.\n\nThat's it. Every everyone's everything's still under one umbrella. So, yeah, fantastic. So, you with regards to where you managed to get to, Alex, so it was from where you were before the program. You're at zero with the business. Right? And then in the four month time frame, you scaled to forty k per month.\n\nMhmm.\n\nPerfect. Amazing.\n\nAnd just reiterate the the niche you were actually in and then your previous experience with that because it's very, very interesting. Because like you said, there is a blue ocean. I've never seen anyone else step into it. So if you can just clarify, you know, the niche and what you actually do for these for the niche Mhmm. That'd be great.\n\nYeah. So we have screen printing and embroidery companies. So, effectively, if you see any event or stadium that has, like, ten thousand shirts printed, those are the clients we work with. It's a very unique industry. And the only reason we got into that was because I had my own shop for six years.\n\nI thought I made a mistake of thinking since I was good at my own shop, I could easily do it for other people.\n\nOur service delivery on the other end was basically what I did for myself, and I just replicated it into these other shops.\n\nBut it's a lot harder it's a lot easier said than done. There's a lot of little nuances that I wasn't prepared for.\n\nYep. Hundred percent. And, you know, you had that competitive advantage of sort of, prior to entering this niche niche. Sorry. You yourself was already a business owner in that niche, so you know you knew exactly what to say and what to do.\n\nAnd that sort of explains, you know, one of the core reasons why you're able to grow so so quickly. So from the program, Alex, just walk me through, you know, your sort of experience from it, you know, from, you know, the start, as well as as you were starting to grow. So from the very first day you entered the program, how did you sort of, progress through things, and how did you sort of, you know, slowly grow the business?\n\nMhmm. Yeah. So when I first joined the program, I was really excited to get started. There's a lot of information at once.\n\nYeah. So you get kinda lost at first. But then I I kinda took a step back and realized, like, what's my biggest bottleneck within my business right now? What is the what's the biggest thing I could do right now?\n\nAnd for me, it was basically just setting up our first client acquisition system because I was confident that if I go on a sales call, I could probably close the deal because I knew the language.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo since I had so many years within the niche, I can talk to them and talk about their equipment and go pretty deep. And I guess before we get into this too, I spent six years my print shop actually had, like, higher revenue than my actual marketing agency. Yep. But the difference was it took me six years to get there. Yeah. Whereas for this, it took me four months to get to a very similar number.\n\nSo when I first got to Easy Grow, the first thing I did was learn how to build the outbound systems.\n\nSo once you join Easy Grow, there's a thing called acquisition genesis, and that kinda teaches you the theory of, client acquisition. Yep. Each video is, like, two hours long. So what the way I approached it was like a shopping list.\n\nWhatever question I had, I kinda searched it into the bar. I found that little spot, gave me some guidance, and then I executed. So So I'd look for something. For example, setting up Calendly, I didn't know how to do that.\n\nSo I just watched the video on how to set Calendly, so I set that up. The videos are really long, but they cover, like, almost any question you might run into. So the first thing I do is I set up the calendar, and I'm like, okay. This works.\n\nAnd then next, I went down to the outbound systems because I knew how to write cold emails and set that up. But now I can confirm or deny whether or not I set it up correctly. So I made some small tweaks, and then you could also pick up different strategies from different programs. So I took some of their outbound strategies, adjusted it to my business because you can't just copy and paste a strategy and expect it to work.\n\nSo when you do join these courses, you wanna take the strategy and implement it into your own business.\n\nSo it's kinda like they gave you the shoe, now you have to craft it and mold it so it fits your foot.\n\nThat's that's exactly it. Yeah. And there's a few things to take away from, you know, what you just mentioned there. The first part about the fact that you've had six years worth of experience in the industry, you know, the, common misconception, especially with, you know, some client interviews and what tends to happen, with a lot of people that watch these things is, you know, come over here.\n\nYou know, they're gonna see that, you know, Alex scaled from zero to fifty k per month in four months. And they're just gonna assume that, wow. You know? Maybe, you know, we can do this as well.\n\nBut, actually, the reason why you actually scale from zero to fifty k per month, yes, it was our systems and, you know, the guidance and all that good stuff. But like you said, Alex, you already had six years of industry expertise before even touching an agency. You had experience in sales, business, and all that jazz, and you were able to just, you know, package that into a different business and succeed straight away. So that's the first thing, and I also appreciate you prefacing that as well because, again, I I've spoken to other students about this where they get disheartened when they see, you know, quick growth, but then for them, they don't see quick growth.\n\nAnd it's like you know? But the person in question had years of business experience before they pursued this, for example. Whereas you, this is your first year at any form of business. So that's, like, the difference in in experience that was there.\n\nAnd, you know, from what you mentioned as well, the second thing that you, picked up on, which also ties to the point you made about, tailoring the outreach stuff, emails to your own business, is pretty much what AcquisitionGenesis teaches. So it's like it teaches you how to think for yourself and how to set up your own systems and why the frameworks work the the way they are able to work.\n\nYou've probably seen this yourself, Alex, and you can probably, you know, elaborate on this a bit further.\n\nWith some programs, they just give you the vehicles, right, and the the copies and, you know, all the shiny mesh shiny object stuff, but they don't teach the why is it laid out like this. You know? What's the reasoning behind it? That and if you don't understand that, you'll never be able to craft, you know, messaging and systems that are tailored for your sort of specific industry. So on that note, Alex, that was helpful to you, right, when you were actually going through AG and all of the frameworks. Were you able to you know, how were you able to sort of tailor it to your business very much?\n\nYeah. For for me, I feel like I guess from being a business owner, you kinda learn that you can't just copy and paste things into your business and expect it to work. For me, what I did was I followed their instructions to see if they did it differently than the way I did it. And then I took my email copy and compared it to their email copy, and I deleted what was bad for mine.\n\nAnd I took what's good from theirs, and I deleted what I didn't like about theirs and put it to mine. So you kinda get a blend of both of them together. And then you also have coaches within the program. So Yeah.\n\nI think that's, like, probably the best part too. So you can do that homework. Basically, you compare your you do it yourself, and then you compare it to their program. You blend it together, and then you bring it to a coach.\n\nAnd then you can ask the coach, like, how would they like, any feedback on this. That way, you you do the homework. You do it yourself. You compare.\n\nYou ask the coach to check it over. And then the last check is just testing it with the market. So you send it to the market, and then you learn an easy drill that, like, it's not whether or not a system works. It's, like, how much it works.\n\nSo you want to troubleshoot the bottlenecks. So if your open rate on the emails isn't high, then maybe change the subject line and don't change anything else.\n\nOne thing in easy to grow too is it's really easy to get emotional. Like, oh, the emails, like, aren't opening. I'm not getting any booked appointments.\n\nBut the work that you put in today, you don't really see it until a few weeks later. So the clients you do outreach to today, you won't get them as clients till, like, four or five weeks later.\n\nYeah. And, yeah, it's it's funny that you say that for, like, people that are watching this interview now. You know, what Alex is speaking about here is not only do we provide, the course content, of course, but we've got literally coaching calls on so many different areas with sales calls, sales calls, sales coaching, sales call audits, outbound coaching, and all this stuff. So, what you just mentioned there, Alex, is, for example, you draft up your own version of the email.\n\nYou'd get it approved in the group, for example. You test it out. You'd bring the metrics, and you have the option of going to a coach to hear what they do differently. So it's an extremely, you know, competitive advantage to have when you're not just reliant on videos alone and you have people to actually guide you on that step.\n\nAnd then the the the other thing that you, that you actually mentioned there was was actually to do with being emotional. I nearly forgot that part. It was being emotional where I've seen it as well, where in the program, you get one bad email reply, and it's like, oh my god. We're done.\n\nThe copy doesn't work, etcetera, etcetera. Hey. I sent ten emails. I'm not getting any responses.\n\nI called called ten people. I'm not getting any. Key here is to read data and make decisions based off of data, a sufficient amount of data to, like you said, understand the bottlenecks and do what needs to be done. And, you know, from your experience, Alex, how sort of important was that, to you to be able to understand, like, the concept of not being emotional and solely start operating from a place of data.\n\nWhereas before, you may have been going a bit, you know, blind as many people do when they don't know what direction they're going in in terms of when to make a decision to adjust things.\n\nYeah. No. That's a really good point, Norah. And I think, honestly, I don't think the emotional side really goes away because at the end of the day, we're all human, so your thoughts are gonna come into play. Yep.\n\nBut if you don't have the data, it's really hard to find out what to do next. The data will give you, like, exactly what to do. Because if you base all the things off emotions, I will say, like, before I started the program, I'm excited. So I'm super motivated.\n\nAs you start sending, you might not get results right away, so you might feel a little bit down. But then you have to look at the metrics. Are you getting opens? Are you getting replies?\n\nAnd you can rely on that data, not necessarily tied to revenue. And the important thing too is that the like, when you grow, you're not only growing in revenue, you can grow in other ways. Your your team can grow. You can learn different things.\n\nAnd you as an entrepreneur will continue to grow and and learn different skills.\n\nBut I think even now, like, when we hit fifty k, the emotional side still kicks in. And then I have to take a step back and look at the data. That way it gives you some kind of metric to look for and see where to go from there.\n\nIt's it's super easy to rely on on your emotions.\n\nSo outside of the agency, I'm also in the army, and a lot of the training kinda coincides too. A lot of the training processes in the army, as you can imagine, they're kinda emotionless. So, like, when you're tired, sleepy, hungry, don't wanna be there, you can just follow these step by step things based off the data that's in front of you and then make a decision. And you wanna kinda approach business the same way.\n\nJust read all the data. If you don't know what decision to make next, it's because you don't have enough data. So you look at the metrics. And if you're lost, programs like EasyGrow, you can just reach out to the coaches or post in the community and rely on other people for input.\n\nAt end of the day, when you reach out for input, you're just getting more data. So if you don't know what to do next, just get more data and then make a decision is the way I can approach it.\n\nIt sounds it sounds so simplistic, and people watching this will probably think, is that it? It's like, yeah.\n\nWell, at the core of it, it's literally when we have data, we can understand where your bottlenecks are immediately.\n\nAnd, you know, you know this as well, Alex. With every outreach system we have, we've got metric tracking sheets, key KPIs that we wanna look for, and key, you know, different types of data that will help us understand what the problems are. And, you know, with with some situations, if you're running outbound, any form of outreach, whether it's outbound or inbound, if you're running it blind without data, right, whether it's for yourself or for your clients, you're not gonna be able to, you know, do anything. You might have a lucky break where you've signed a couple of clients, but you won't know how you actually done that.\n\nSo you can't replicate the success. So, yeah, that's good to know that you actually benefited, you know, specific specifically from the heavy overload of data. I know that you're probably you're probably sick to death by the amount of data that you've probably looked at from all the different process that we have. So, yeah, that's good.\n\nAnd, you know, I'm curious to know, Alex, from your perspective because, you know, as you've already said yourself, you've used, you know, the the group. You've used their content. You've also gone on, you know, coaching calls. Like, I've seen you myself on the rare coaching calls I've hosted.\n\nAnd what would you say, like, are your sort of favorite parts of the program, and what specifically benefited you and your situation, would you say?\n\nYeah. I think my favorite part so I joined other programs before. I I don't wanna name them here, but, the founders of those programs, they're either late or they, like, just don't show up to their own coaching calls, and they just put in other coaches to replace them. But here, Charlie and Beau, the founders of Easy Grow, they're actually there on Monday and Friday, and they actually, like, remember your business, I guess.\n\nSo when I first run the program, I asked them a question. Next week, I I came on the program, asked them a question. And, like, Charlie and Beau, they kinda, like they're more personable. So they actually remember the context beforehand, and they're like, oh, you're the guy that does the t shirt business or whatever it is right now.\n\nI'm like, yeah. So they remember the context, and it feels more personable.\n\nAnd it's really nice to get in proximity of an entrepreneur that's doing, like, eight figures.\n\nAgain, the other pro other other programs, when the founders are at that level, like, eight figures, they don't wanna hop on to the coaching calls. Whereas Charlie and Bo are always on the coaching calls, and they try to answer every question. One thing that's nice about Easy Grow too is that you put the question in the chat. That way your question actually gets answered. Other programs, you raise your hand, and maybe when two guys get their questions answered, everyone else is just listening in.\n\nSo that's my favorite thing about Easy Grow that the founder's on time, and your question actually gets answered. And if you can't make the coaching call, you can post in the community and tag the coach, and then they can answer your question there.\n\nYep. Great stuff. Yeah. It's funny because, you mentioned that the fact that all the founders are on the call and the founders are on time. In my head, I'm thinking, is that is that really the favorite thing, Alex? Isn't that supposed to be the bare minimum?\n\nSo yeah. Because I I've been I've been a part of, you know, programs similar to it's exactly what you described where you are part of coaching calls, but there's no structure to it. However, the founder's not there, and there's no clear order. So you're listening to one person ramble on.\n\nAnd it's just that, like, a hands up system. So whereas with our one, it's just, you know, questions in the chat. We're gonna go over each issue one by one. And as you mentioned, Alex, it's personable.\n\nAnd I think, that sort of ref is a reflection on, sort of, you know, our our values here where we we take sort of every sign up genuinely seriously. Like, I I I'm a you know, you know me. I handle support in the group. I've had some calls as well, the coaching calls.\n\nI'm aware of different people's situations.\n\nAnd it's not it's not as if, you know, I do my job, but that's it. I completely forget about you. And, you know, that person who touch is really important because like you said, it goes a long way for as from a client experience because you're like, wow. These guys genuinely do care.\n\nIt's not just a matter of them taking my money, and they just you know, apologies for swearing in advance, half assing, you you know, support. So, yeah, love that, man. Love that. Alex, I'm actually curious to know, because I think you did mention my cold email as one of the systems you use to, sort of, you know, generate appointments.\n\nWere there any other specific strategies that helped you, you know, generate appointments, meetings? And was there anything else like the, you know, like the sales training that was of value to you? It'd be great to understand what other areas would would that you actually used, to get your agency to the point where it is now.\n\nYeah. And before we get into that too, I meant to mention for the coaches, other coaching programs, they have a lot of coaches, but the quality of the coaching isn't as high. So Easy Grow's coaches are usually part of the staff where they have a lot of credibility. On the program that I hopped on, there is a, like, service delivery coach, like Jimmy Mitchell.\n\nHe is the service delivery coach here, and he's run his agency for, like, years, and he does a hundred k plus. Hold on, Jimmy. Yeah. Exactly.\n\nUncle Jimmy.\n\nBut the other programs, I joined their coaching calls, and, like, the coach hasn't been passing ten k a month. And I'm like, I don't know if I want you helping me right now with these ads, which, I mean, the information might be really good, but it's just the credibility isn't there. See, I don't know if I rely on that information as much.\n\nBut for the other material in Easy Grow, one other thing too was my sales calls were all over the place. So when I first joined the calls, I just, like, rushed to get booked appointments. As soon as I got booked appointments, I was like, alright. I can sell.\n\nSo I hopped on the call, and then I realized there's no structure to the call. So it's hard to replicate your results over and over again. So I just took each call, and each call is, like, completely different. And then my close rate was really low.\n\nI didn't track any of these numbers.\n\nAnd I was trying to figure out what was wrong. So then I went to the sales modules and I just so they give you their script, but you can't just copy their script because it's not gonna work for your business. So it's the same thing again where you take that script and you modify it. So what I did was I took their script. I modified it to my niche. So I know a lot of keywords and terms that I picked up from my specific niche, and I added it to our sales script.\n\nOne thing too is their sales process is very clear on, basically, you're not even supposed to close anybody. First guy diagnosed the issue and see if they even qualify. And then if you think you can truly help them, it's almost on you that you have to help them. Like, if you're a doctor that can help a blind man see, and and if you don't wanna help him, that's, like, almost on you.\n\nSo you gotta see if you can help the person. And then if you can help them, then you can use the sales techniques and and tactics that they teach you to convince that person to drag them over the line. So that's my favorite thing. Like, each program teaches sales a little bit differently, but I like Charlie's, way of selling.\n\nIt's very ethical, and I think it matches my style.\n\nYeah.\n\nAdditionally, in the sales SOPs, they give you, like, their actual SOPs. So we took those and just copy and pasted those sheets and those metrics. And since they're metrics, those you can actually copy and paste and just put that into your business.\n\nKey key KPIs. Yeah. That's it. That's it.\n\nSo yes. So so the sales process was really helpful, and then they also have agency service delivery modules. So, basically, anything I needed I, like, I didn't go on YouTube for, like, three months because everything I needed was an easy grow, and I could just look it up and find it in there. But that's basically how I approached the the program.\n\nYeah. Love it. So it's like you just got value from different areas where it's like, alright. I'm gonna get some stuff from the email side of things to copy and stuff like this.\n\nBoom. Let's get that working. Sales stuff. Let me dig in here.\n\nService delivery. Can we check out uncle Jimmy's stuff or, you know, calls, I mean, then the stuff in the program. So, yeah, that's another thing. It just covers all bases, and it's nice where, from your experience, it sounds like once you figured out one problem, you're able to find some the next problem and just solve it from the course immediately.\n\nMhmm. Yeah. And if you don't know, you can just post in the community or ask the coaches.\n\nThat's it. That's it. Perfect, man. And, you know, I wanted to ask, what would your sort of advice be to, you know, to sort of students where, or to not even existing students, but just people in general, that want to achieve, you know, the level of success that you've got, Alex. Like, what characteristics, skills, traits would they would they need to have? Because, you know, obviously, you've picked up some really good skills and stuff from our program, and it'd be great to hear your perspective on that, especially those struggling as well. Mhmm.\n\nYeah. The way, I really like the way Charlie puts it, and it's not that it's it's in business, it's kinda you have to become the person who can is is kinda like the the motto of of easy grow.\n\nSo if you're not making, like, a hundred thousand dollars a month right now, it's it's not really outside of it's like you're not the person that has the skills to do so yet, or you don't know the information that you need to or you don't know the people to get to that level.\n\nSo for me, if I were to, like, restart the program, at first, I did expect it to be easy, but you kinda realize that anything worthwhile is really hard.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo I would expect it to be really hard, and then I would rely on the the inputs. So there's, like, five videos about systems.\n\nFor for when you're trying to do something, the output, the result itself is really hard to control, but you can control the inputs. So if you set up a list of things to do every day and you just do those things and you do that every single day, you'll start to pick up momentum and pick up results. And if you don't, you can just go into one of the coaching programs.\n\nBut I think the biggest thing for me is becoming the person who is deserving of that whatever revenue goals you might have, and just learning the skills that you need to basically generate the revenue. Because at the end of the day, you're solving problems for other business owners. That was one thing I didn't really understand too at first in terms of deliverability. Like so for the niche I was in before, we print a t shirt.\n\nSo you gave us money. We gave you your logo on a t shirt. That was very clear. For me, when I entered the marketing world, I'm like, what are we doing?\n\nSo at first, I was like, okay. I'll get you clients. But you realize each little business has their own way to get clients. Not every business is the same.\n\nSo it took me a while to learn what you're actually delivering. So I guess if I were to restart the program, what I would do is exactly the same way I did it, get those appointments set, learn sales, and then once you get a few clients, then learn the service delivery. You don't wanna spend too much time learning everything at once. So I'd learn, implement, learn, implement, because then the next problem kinda arises. If you learn how to do service delivery right away, you'll find that the service delivery that you created won't even match the problems that you're you're coming up with. I'm not sure if that makes sense.\n\nNo. No. I I completely agree. It's like you what you just described there is if you're trying to, learn things about a hundred k problems when you have one k problems, it just it doesn't make sense. Like, you need to approach it piece by piece, almost level by level like a video game. Even like yourself, Alex, where you've grown from a zero to, you know, forty k per month, now you're progressing beyond that. Right?\n\nYou know, it's just different levels and new problems. And if you were to learn everything at zero, you wouldn't be, going anywhere. So yeah.\n\nYeah. I will say the first, like, ten thousand is also the hardest.\n\nLike Yeah.\n\nCompletely the hardest because you have, like, no other resources.\n\nOne thing that I'm still learning is you can kinda pay your way out of doing things. So if you don't wanna take sales calls, once you're good enough at getting booked appointments, you can bring in a closer. If all you wanna do is do sales, then you can bring in someone to help you with the service delivery. Yeah.\n\nBut, yeah, it kinda comes down to having those systems and the metrics, though. So I I will say, when you're by yourself, it's kinda easy because you have an idea what's going on with everything. Once you start hiring team members, you need those metrics so you can get a pulse on how each part of the business is doing. Yeah. So I basically just copied all the metrics trackers from Easy Grow and put into my business.\n\nThat's it. Perfect, man. So, yeah, we're we've we've gone over, like, revenue, wise for the business, Alex. How I'm curious as to know what the structure of your sort of company looks right now compared to how it was before.\n\nLike, what was the you know, do you have a team now? Do you have, like, you know, different people managing different peep different things? What does it, what does it look like? Yeah.\n\nSo right now, when I first started, it was just myself, and I was in the process of running my print shop at the same time. I'll say in, like honestly, it was in December when I finalized the sale and sold off all my equipment. It was not a fancy exit. I just liquidated my equipment. Honestly, I had a loss. But I was just by myself, and then I first hired as a VA to kinda take off those tasks. There's a quote that I heard is that if you don't have an assistant, you are the assistant.\n\nSo the first thing I did was I made my schedule for the day, and I looked at the task I had, and I handed those off to the virtual assistant. So things like lead scraping, setting up those outbound systems. If you have those SOPs in place, which you can copy and paste from Easy Grow because the SOPs are very similar, you can hand it off to somebody else. But my team right now, we have two VAs to help out with the service delivery, and then we're onboarding a client success manager to help me with the fulfillment and onboarding on the back end. And then we have one closer on the front end, and that's our structure right now. In between when I first started till now, we hired white label agencies. We tried three or four different white label agencies.\n\nWe had different ISAs. So the team grows and shrinks. But right now, it's two VAs, one, almost like an ops manager to kind of remove myself from the fulfillment, and then we have a closer on the front end.\n\nYeah. Love it, man. And you literally came into this, as a one man army.\n\nLiterally just hand handling it yourself, and now you're in a position where, you know, you you've got, like, a mini team in place, and you're sort of transitioning into that space where you're trying to be a top quality recruiter so you'd be able to scale to the next part, which is what a lot of people struggle with because they're so good at being a business owner, but then it's time to be a recruiter to truly, you know, get to seven figures and beyond. So, yeah, great stuff.\n\nWhat would you say, Alex, would be your your goals moving forward, with with the business. It'd be good to understand, you know, get a pulse check on that and, you know, the the direction you wanna take things in.\n\nYes. So that's a good question, Noor. Right now, we're in a weird stage of pivoting. So in January, we had so many book calls. Like, if we really wanted to and gas it, I think we woulda hit a hundred k at the rate we're going.\n\nBut our service delivery, kinda was broken on the back end, and I wanna make sure we have a really good product.\n\nSo if it's it's kinda like that analogy where if you wanna build the fastest tower and and you have, like, ten minutes to build it, you only can build it so far.\n\nSo what I realized is whatever you build now, it's gonna break. And my philosophy was, like, just break it as fast as we can. So we built something like a really small minimal viable product. We built the system, and then we broke the system. Built the system, break the system. So right now, we're in that period of of building. So from fifty k a month, we kinda took a pause, and we're like, we wanna make sure everyone gets really good results.\n\nAnd then what I did was I systematized the fulfillment.\n\nSo I set up, like, SOPs. Like, if I onboard to someone new today, these are the steps that they have to do.\n\nSome of the mistakes I made was that I thought I can replace myself with one person.\n\nAnd, clearly, it's it's hard to put all those skills into one person, especially if you lose that person too, then you have to start over. So what we did was we effectively trained each person on one specific task, and then they take care of that task. If they leave you, you'll still be okay. You can just train somebody new.\n\nBut for our direction in the future right now is I think we're gonna take it one level higher. So right now, we're helping screen printing shops. Most of them are b to b. And now I realized, that we can help almost any b to b business and get them more b to b leads.\n\nMost recently, in our industry, we can help the screen printers, but there's also people who manufacture machines for these printers.\n\nSo I've been getting approached by different companies actually to help them with their marketing. And their machines the smallest machine they have is, like, fifty thousand dollars, and they're, like, an enterprise company. So their budget is, like, almost through the roof.\n\nFor them to hire a marketing agency like myself, it's actually way cheaper for them to hire, like, a marketing director who probably doesn't know how to run Facebook ads or do any of that kind of stuff.\n\nSo most recently, we signed a deal with a with a equipment manufacturing company. So I realized our first pivot was going from brick and mortars to online businesses, helping b two b. And then now we realize we can move up market towards bigger b two b companies. Because right now, we're getting book calls for screen printing.\n\nSo if you want, like, that's I feel that's pretty hard, getting people to get book calls for custom T shirt printing. It's actually even easier to do it for, like, a different type of company. So now moving forward, we're restructuring our service delivery. We're also So that's, like, the best part.\n\nSo that's why the first ten k is so difficult. You have to take on everybody, even if they're bad clients, good clients. You kinda sell everybody. But once you get to a certain point, you can get rid of the bad clients and focus on the good clients.\n\nAnd you'll realize that the good clients, they pay you more and they take less time to manage, and they actually get better results too because they're also good business owners.\n\nSo that'll be one of the biggest things I realized. It's not hard forever. It gets a little bit easier. Yeah.\n\nThat's it. Amazing, man. And, I love the point you made about how you said, yeah, we could have scaled this to the moon to a hundred k per month.\n\nThat would have made for a a great interview title. But at the same time, from a business perspective, it won't be the right move because, you know, operationally, yeah, you'd have the fancy Stripe account that'll just you can flash, and that number's gone in one month if without proper operations. So, yeah, that's a that's a fantastic, like, business decision from your end, Alex, to just sort of maintain what you're doing and, you know, work on systems and and things like this, which you already spoke about, you know, before we before even the the call. But, yeah, that's that's fantastic.\n\nAnd another point I like is what you made about the pivot side of thing where it's like, yes. You got b two b, you know, printed companies. You've got a proof of concept here. But then the the framework you have, it can be applicable to other markets.\n\nAnd more import more more specifically, you found an alternative market that's linked to, you know, T shirt printing in some way with the machine specifically. So it's fantastic, man. And, yeah, I'm curious to see, you know, what the future looks like for you. And I'm excited because I I, obviously, run the operations for, you know, easy growth.\n\nSo what really makes me happy is whenever I see a student or a client like yourself, for example, they say, hey, man. Gonna Gonna pause things that I'm fixing up at the back end. I'm like, yes. This is this is a big win.\n\nForget forget more and more clients because I've seen situations where people just scale up ridiculously fast.\n\nThey're without a proper team, without proper fulfillment, Alex, and it's just ego driven. They want the number. They think it's quick cash, but it's just not sustainable. So, yeah, really good stuff, and that's good to know about your future plan in that regard. And I wanna before we sort of finish up the the interview, Alex, one question I I wanna ask is, you know, how has the growth in the business sort of affected your, your personal life? Because we spoke just before, you know, we started recording this interview.\n\nBusiness owners, they tend to be locked in. They get into the Formula one car. They zoom it's like that man in the arena quote. They're in the arena.\n\nThey don't care about anything else. They just keep on fighting and fighting and fighting, and they don't realize their progression and and how far they've actually come. So I'd love to hear your perspective on, you know, how life has changed, if it did change significantly before you started this business. But, yeah, it'd be great to hear your perspective on how things have changed for you.\n\nYeah. No. That's a really good question.\n\nBefore I started, we had we had the printing business, but say, like, the revenue was, like, sixty k. Our lease or rent was already, like, eight k. Equipment financing was a bunch of money. Labor, insurance, taxes on payroll, everything was American labor, so that was super expensive.\n\nAnd then we had cost of goods. So say, like, we made sixty k that month. My profit margin was, like, three, four thousand. At the end of the day, I'm like, this this kinda blows.\n\nSo once I go over to that business, also, I hated printing T shirts.\n\nA lot of people didn't know that. But when I was talking to Seb, which is the salesperson who I was talking to when I first joined Easy Grow, he was telling me, like, if you switch markets, I guarantee you you're gonna be like, you're gonna do really well. And, like, if you look at our old email chains, we almost, like, predicted where we'd end up.\n\nBut, in terms of our life, when I first joined Easy Grow, one, I was really upset with, like, printing T shirts. I really didn't like that. And two, I really wanted to learn how to do this online stuff. That way I can work wherever because I have to travel a lot for the army.\n\nSo once I got rid of that side and focus on this side, I was happier because I really like the work. The work was a lot better just sitting on a computer compared to, like, manually printing all the shirts and, like, the the air is really bad and it's super hot.\n\nIt's basically a modern sweatshop. It was it's the way way I like to put it. But once we got rid of that stuff, when I first started Easy Grow, I actually couldn't even walk, because I had training in June and July, and I hurt my ankle toward the ligaments of my ankle till I got surgery. So from August until well, that's pretty recently. I started walking again. I couldn't walk, so I just sat here at my computer and just worked on the business.\n\nThe biggest thing I I realized was, like, I was just working, like, ridiculous hours, like, fifteen, sixteen hours a day. I realized that you have to optimize your hours because at some point, you do hit burnout. I was a big guy. I'm like, dude, you can't burnout. It's, like, impossible to burnout. But at a certain point, you'll hit, like, a brick wall, and you can't really your your, production your work capacity just gets so low that's not even worth it that you're better off just taking a break, stepping back, and and lowering the hours, but making sure those hours are really, really productive.\n\nSo most recently, we actually cut back I cut back on the amount of hours we're working, and I decided to sleep more. And in return, I've been getting way more work done in less time.\n\nSo that's that's really important. The second thing too is I do feel more confident now that if, like, worst case never happened, I feel like I have the skills to at least make a baseline minimum. So for example, if I sold everything off right now, I can finally I could probably find a closer position, like, somewhere else and just sell for a different company. And my minimum income for the month would probably be at least ten thousand.\n\nSo for my life, I'm not really a big spender. But I guess the most recent thing I've done is is I got, like, a new apartment, like, a nicer apartment. Scobins.\n\nIt's, like, not a fancy, like, penthouse, but, like, a top floor of the building, and it's just by myself.\n\nAnd I can That's it.\n\nLive out there, and I'll be alright.\n\nOther than that, life hasn't changed too much other than, I guess, the person I became. Now I'm pretty confident again that if everything came, like, worse came to worse, I can just learn how I can I know how to sell now, so I can just sell for your business?\n\nI love that, man. I love that. And, you know, you said you you couldn't walk. I think I think we spoke about that, you know, on email over email about your situation.\n\nAnd it's like, maybe it was destiny for you to be at your laptop, man, in the meantime. I think you're at the business. But, no, jokes aside, like, super happy. You know, you're able to walk again, and, you know, because you got the business running whilst you're still recovering.\n\nAnd, yeah, it's amazing. Like, you know, the apartment's a big win. You had the freedom to actually upgrade your apartment. I'm sure you could have gone, an even nicer apartment, but I'm sure you're being, you know, sensible where some people just blow it, put out all their money away.\n\nBut the the part about being confident, Alex, that's such a massive win where you've got a sense of power now and control where even if your business, you know, for whatever reason, god forbid, it just disappeared, you're in a position where you've learned the skills, you know, skills, characteristics, and traits from your own experience outside of Easy Grow, but also the things you've learned throughout Easy Grow to be able to rebuild yourself, whether it's restarting the business or, like you said, tap into other opportunities from the skill set you developed. And I think that's another underrated thing that a lot of, success stories that we have, they don't realize that.\n\nLike, what you just said there where it's like, they're they actually got power. Like, they can go, hey. If I lose this, I can just easily build enough one or just tap into something else because I know how to do things. I don't I'm not relying on copying and pasting things.\n\nI understand, you know, the frameworks and principles behind, you know, the things I actually do. So, yeah, that that's fantastic. And it's always great to hear, you know, not just like the the materialistic wins where, obviously, people get some money. You know, they they buy some nice things.\n\nThey look after their family, which is amazing.\n\nBut I love hearing the identity shift wins as well where you're a much more confident person now, and that translates to, you know, all areas of your life, and that just comes from having the sense of power. So, yeah, good stuff, man. So final question for you, Alex.\n\nAs you're aware, people are gonna be watching this interview, probably existing students, but also people that aren't a customer of the program yet. And, naturally, they just want to hear, you know, other students' perspective on the program.\n\nWhat would you say to someone that is on the fence about, you know, joining the program? Because I'm sure perhaps when you, you know, were looking into the program itself, you may have had reservations naturally, right, or questions.\n\nWhat would you say to that person out there that's watching this interview that's, you know, thinking about it and, is on defense as to whether this may or may not be a good fit for them?\n\nYeah. No. That's a great question. I guess we'll start with, like, the worst things that I didn't like about Easy Grow.\n\nI guess at first, it's like there's so much information that's given to you at once that you almost feel lost.\n\nSo if you aren't, like, willing to work, I guess like, some people expect when you buy the course, that's, like, the win and that they don't have to do anything. Like, that's the sense of accomplishment.\n\nSo I wouldn't buy the course if you don't want to put in the the work and expect fast cash.\n\nI wouldn't wanna buy it if you're not actually trying to solve someone's issues and you just wanna sell. Yep. One of the big things, especially from the coaches here, is that you actually wanna deliver good results. Yeah. I've joined other programs where all they've preached is just sell, sell, sell. Like, it doesn't really matter, about the back end. So that's what I liked about Easy Grow.\n\nIt was actually Charlie and Mort Charlie and, and Bo actually told me to pause client acquisition when I got to the point where I was at. So I think that's a a big testimonial for for the person they are. They're like, yeah. I mean, if you want client acquisition, I showed them the numbers, and they said, like, your client acquisition really isn't the issue right now. Like, you might as well just pause client acquisition. They said they probably never recommend that to anybody else.\n\nBut they told me to work on the product side. So, that's why I paused client acquisition. But if you're looking to join a program or you want everything in one place, I think Easy Grow is the easiest place to do it. I will say that it's not done for you. Like, you have to do the work yourself.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat's probably the the biggest thing. But if you are willing to do the work and you are willing to learn and you're willing to try new things and really put in the volume, it's kinda like joining the gym. Like, no matter what gym you join, if you don't work out, you're not gonna get the results.\n\nSo that's the type of person you have to be if you wanna join this program. But if you are willing to put in the work and you're willing like, you just want the step by step instructions on how to do everything, then I would do it. And if you ever get lost, reach out to, like, Noor. I I believe I've reached out to Noor a few times when I like, there's just so so, like, way too much information. I don't know where to go.\n\nYou can always post into the community. That's my favorite thing. But, yes, if you're on the fence here and your only reservation is that you don't know if you'll get results, the guarantee is is really powerful.\n\nAnd there's just so much information on the back end.\n\nI will say I'm trying to think of the bad things in the program so that I can lay everything out, but it it's really hard to identify bad things. Again, the only bad thing I would say is that there's so much at once almost that you kinda get lost. Yeah.\n\nAnd, and if not done for you, you have to do the work.\n\nThat's Of course. Very clear that you have to put in the work.\n\nBut, yeah, again, if you're willing to put in the work, I think easy grow is probably the best program Yeah. That I've been into. It just covers all bases. It gives you basically every issue that you might run into. And what I also really like about Easy Grow is that they continue to add more programs.\n\nYep.\n\nI think that just kinda shows who they are too. Most recently, like, Charlie posted saying, like, how can I make this better for you? Yeah. And other programs don't do that at all. Since I joined Easy Grow, there's been two or three new modules that came out. There's, like, probably double the number of coaching calls, so the program continues to to grow. Yeah.\n\nSo, yeah, I guess long story short, if you're willing to put in the work, just join Easy Grow, and you'll grow pretty quick as long as you're willing to do in the work.\n\nIf you're if you're lazy, you don't wanna do it, then I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nYeah. I I love the transparency, man. Even, like, the negative of how there's so much in there. It can be overwhelming.\n\nNaturally but then, you know, it's one of those ones where, like you mentioned, Alex, that's where the group support is. That's where the coaching calls are. Yes. You gotta do it yourself.\n\nYou know, you gotta go through the program yourself, but we like to call it a done with you solution because you got us. You got us in the group. You got us in coaching calls where you can speak to us directly. You've done it yourself, Alex, where, you know, you can attest to this.\n\nYou aren't just flying solo.\n\nAny questions you needed, it was covered. And, yeah, so so I'll rebuttal that to anyone watching who will be overwhelmed with information.\n\nI can say you probably will, but in a good way. And, you know, we we still have this, Alex. It's funny that you mentioned where you get the odd student that goes, I don't know where to start. It's like, hey.\n\nLet let me know what your issues are, and then I could point you in the right direction. Because similar to you, Alex, you're just using the search bar, and you just went bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, got it solved. So yeah. And then the other point you raised, it's people willing to work, like you mentioned, perfect fit for the program.\n\nI I'm we're we're all very blunt, and I'm not just saying that from personal standpoint because I because I'm British and, you know, British people tend to be quite blunt and straightforward. But, you know, I'm not gonna package this as something as, you come in the program, and that's that immediate success. Like, Alex is a perfect example of this where, you know, he's grafted. He's I see him in coaching calls.\n\nI see him in in the group. He's had years of experience in business before but he still had to put in the work. So as Alex mentioned, you know, if you're on the fence by your someone that's willing to work and you just need to understand what you wanna work on, we can help with that. But like Alex also put it, if you're someone that doesn't wanna put in the work, then there there there's probably other solutions better for you, instead of this.\n\nBut yeah. Perfect, man. Really, really good to know.\n\nKnow that, Alex, and I'm sure, you know, the people watching this would appreciate that, especially those that are on the fence. But, yeah, that's pretty much it for the interview. Everyone that's watching this, you know, if you are open to learning more about the program, feel free to just, you know, book a call, and you can find out if you're a good fit for it. Alternatively, you know, you can check out the other interviews that we have on the website, and just check out Charlie's YouTube channel as well because that is where you'll get, a bit of a taste of the type of, you know, value that we bring and what we actually teach.\n\nSo, yeah, that's pretty much it for the interview. Alex, thank you so much, man. And to everyone watching, I hope you enjoyed it. We'll catch you another time.\n\nCheers.\n\nBye. Yep.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/uh04xzi02k?autoplay=0&wmode=transparent&wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

Hello, everyone, to watching this client interview. You are with Nour here. I run the operation side of Easy Grow.\n\nAnd today, I am joined by, one of our clients called Alex who has done really, really well with the program. And, in this interview, we're just gonna share, pretty much his story and his success with us. So, Alex, good to have you here. We've already spoken just before, you know, the recording started.\n\nBut, yeah, if you can give, like, an intro to who you are, what your agency does, and all that good jazz, it'd be great for the people to have a better understanding of you and your business.\n\nSure. Yeah. Thanks, Noor. Yeah. So I before I go on to the online space, I had my own brick and mortar, brick and mortar location where we printed custom T shirts, custom hats.\n\nSo if you look at Norris hoodie, we can make hoodies like that.\n\nAnd then six years into the pros so about a year ago, I found out about the online space. I actually signed up for a course, and it told me so so I can scale my brick and mortar location. And then he told me that I shouldn't be working with the brick and mortar and said I should just teach other people how to do marketing. So then I thought about that for a little bit.\n\nI joined other coaching programs to see if I can figure out how to set up a marketing agency. But a lot of the other marketing programs, there's not a lot of, like, a through a to z, like, setup. So then in August of last year, I joined Easy Grow, which is Charlie Morgan's program, but I couldn't really start my agency until September. And then for September to January, and January is the first time we hit forty, fifty thousand in one month.\n\nSo the growth has been really quick, but I would say it wasn't easy. It It was kinda painful, and I think it's because we had all the skills that stacked up over the years, and it kind of just I just moved vehicles into a better vehicle. Yeah. And that was the I'd say that's probably the reason of it.\n\nBut I think Easy Grow also has all the tools you need in one place. So you'd have to, like, search on YouTube, spend hours. So when you buy a program like Easy Grow, it kinda cuts your learning time by so you basically add five years to your life, five years of experience into your head.\n\nThat's it. Every everyone's everything's still under one umbrella. So, yeah, fantastic. So, you with regards to where you managed to get to, Alex, so it was from where you were before the program. You're at zero with the business. Right? And then in the four month time frame, you scaled to forty k per month.\n\nMhmm.\n\nPerfect. Amazing.\n\nAnd just reiterate the the niche you were actually in and then your previous experience with that because it's very, very interesting. Because like you said, there is a blue ocean. I've never seen anyone else step into it. So if you can just clarify, you know, the niche and what you actually do for these for the niche Mhmm. That'd be great.\n\nYeah. So we have screen printing and embroidery companies. So, effectively, if you see any event or stadium that has, like, ten thousand shirts printed, those are the clients we work with. It's a very unique industry. And the only reason we got into that was because I had my own shop for six years.\n\nI thought I made a mistake of thinking since I was good at my own shop, I could easily do it for other people.\n\nOur service delivery on the other end was basically what I did for myself, and I just replicated it into these other shops.\n\nBut it's a lot harder it's a lot easier said than done. There's a lot of little nuances that I wasn't prepared for.\n\nYep. Hundred percent. And, you know, you had that competitive advantage of sort of, prior to entering this niche niche. Sorry. You yourself was already a business owner in that niche, so you know you knew exactly what to say and what to do.\n\nAnd that sort of explains, you know, one of the core reasons why you're able to grow so so quickly. So from the program, Alex, just walk me through, you know, your sort of experience from it, you know, from, you know, the start, as well as as you were starting to grow. So from the very first day you entered the program, how did you sort of, progress through things, and how did you sort of, you know, slowly grow the business?\n\nMhmm. Yeah. So when I first joined the program, I was really excited to get started. There's a lot of information at once.\n\nYeah. So you get kinda lost at first. But then I I kinda took a step back and realized, like, what's my biggest bottleneck within my business right now? What is the what's the biggest thing I could do right now?\n\nAnd for me, it was basically just setting up our first client acquisition system because I was confident that if I go on a sales call, I could probably close the deal because I knew the language.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo since I had so many years within the niche, I can talk to them and talk about their equipment and go pretty deep. And I guess before we get into this too, I spent six years my print shop actually had, like, higher revenue than my actual marketing agency. Yep. But the difference was it took me six years to get there. Yeah. Whereas for this, it took me four months to get to a very similar number.\n\nSo when I first got to Easy Grow, the first thing I did was learn how to build the outbound systems.\n\nSo once you join Easy Grow, there's a thing called acquisition genesis, and that kinda teaches you the theory of, client acquisition. Yep. Each video is, like, two hours long. So what the way I approached it was like a shopping list.\n\nWhatever question I had, I kinda searched it into the bar. I found that little spot, gave me some guidance, and then I executed. So So I'd look for something. For example, setting up Calendly, I didn't know how to do that.\n\nSo I just watched the video on how to set Calendly, so I set that up. The videos are really long, but they cover, like, almost any question you might run into. So the first thing I do is I set up the calendar, and I'm like, okay. This works.\n\nAnd then next, I went down to the outbound systems because I knew how to write cold emails and set that up. But now I can confirm or deny whether or not I set it up correctly. So I made some small tweaks, and then you could also pick up different strategies from different programs. So I took some of their outbound strategies, adjusted it to my business because you can't just copy and paste a strategy and expect it to work.\n\nSo when you do join these courses, you wanna take the strategy and implement it into your own business.\n\nSo it's kinda like they gave you the shoe, now you have to craft it and mold it so it fits your foot.\n\nThat's that's exactly it. Yeah. And there's a few things to take away from, you know, what you just mentioned there. The first part about the fact that you've had six years worth of experience in the industry, you know, the, common misconception, especially with, you know, some client interviews and what tends to happen, with a lot of people that watch these things is, you know, come over here.\n\nYou know, they're gonna see that, you know, Alex scaled from zero to fifty k per month in four months. And they're just gonna assume that, wow. You know? Maybe, you know, we can do this as well.\n\nBut, actually, the reason why you actually scale from zero to fifty k per month, yes, it was our systems and, you know, the guidance and all that good stuff. But like you said, Alex, you already had six years of industry expertise before even touching an agency. You had experience in sales, business, and all that jazz, and you were able to just, you know, package that into a different business and succeed straight away. So that's the first thing, and I also appreciate you prefacing that as well because, again, I I've spoken to other students about this where they get disheartened when they see, you know, quick growth, but then for them, they don't see quick growth.\n\nAnd it's like you know? But the person in question had years of business experience before they pursued this, for example. Whereas you, this is your first year at any form of business. So that's, like, the difference in in experience that was there.\n\nAnd, you know, from what you mentioned as well, the second thing that you, picked up on, which also ties to the point you made about, tailoring the outreach stuff, emails to your own business, is pretty much what AcquisitionGenesis teaches. So it's like it teaches you how to think for yourself and how to set up your own systems and why the frameworks work the the way they are able to work.\n\nYou've probably seen this yourself, Alex, and you can probably, you know, elaborate on this a bit further.\n\nWith some programs, they just give you the vehicles, right, and the the copies and, you know, all the shiny mesh shiny object stuff, but they don't teach the why is it laid out like this. You know? What's the reasoning behind it? That and if you don't understand that, you'll never be able to craft, you know, messaging and systems that are tailored for your sort of specific industry. So on that note, Alex, that was helpful to you, right, when you were actually going through AG and all of the frameworks. Were you able to you know, how were you able to sort of tailor it to your business very much?\n\nYeah. For for me, I feel like I guess from being a business owner, you kinda learn that you can't just copy and paste things into your business and expect it to work. For me, what I did was I followed their instructions to see if they did it differently than the way I did it. And then I took my email copy and compared it to their email copy, and I deleted what was bad for mine.\n\nAnd I took what's good from theirs, and I deleted what I didn't like about theirs and put it to mine. So you kinda get a blend of both of them together. And then you also have coaches within the program. So Yeah.\n\nI think that's, like, probably the best part too. So you can do that homework. Basically, you compare your you do it yourself, and then you compare it to their program. You blend it together, and then you bring it to a coach.\n\nAnd then you can ask the coach, like, how would they like, any feedback on this. That way, you you do the homework. You do it yourself. You compare.\n\nYou ask the coach to check it over. And then the last check is just testing it with the market. So you send it to the market, and then you learn an easy drill that, like, it's not whether or not a system works. It's, like, how much it works.\n\nSo you want to troubleshoot the bottlenecks. So if your open rate on the emails isn't high, then maybe change the subject line and don't change anything else.\n\nOne thing in easy to grow too is it's really easy to get emotional. Like, oh, the emails, like, aren't opening. I'm not getting any booked appointments.\n\nBut the work that you put in today, you don't really see it until a few weeks later. So the clients you do outreach to today, you won't get them as clients till, like, four or five weeks later.\n\nYeah. And, yeah, it's it's funny that you say that for, like, people that are watching this interview now. You know, what Alex is speaking about here is not only do we provide, the course content, of course, but we've got literally coaching calls on so many different areas with sales calls, sales calls, sales coaching, sales call audits, outbound coaching, and all this stuff. So, what you just mentioned there, Alex, is, for example, you draft up your own version of the email.\n\nYou'd get it approved in the group, for example. You test it out. You'd bring the metrics, and you have the option of going to a coach to hear what they do differently. So it's an extremely, you know, competitive advantage to have when you're not just reliant on videos alone and you have people to actually guide you on that step.\n\nAnd then the the the other thing that you, that you actually mentioned there was was actually to do with being emotional. I nearly forgot that part. It was being emotional where I've seen it as well, where in the program, you get one bad email reply, and it's like, oh my god. We're done.\n\nThe copy doesn't work, etcetera, etcetera. Hey. I sent ten emails. I'm not getting any responses.\n\nI called called ten people. I'm not getting any. Key here is to read data and make decisions based off of data, a sufficient amount of data to, like you said, understand the bottlenecks and do what needs to be done. And, you know, from your experience, Alex, how sort of important was that, to you to be able to understand, like, the concept of not being emotional and solely start operating from a place of data.\n\nWhereas before, you may have been going a bit, you know, blind as many people do when they don't know what direction they're going in in terms of when to make a decision to adjust things.\n\nYeah. No. That's a really good point, Norah. And I think, honestly, I don't think the emotional side really goes away because at the end of the day, we're all human, so your thoughts are gonna come into play. Yep.\n\nBut if you don't have the data, it's really hard to find out what to do next. The data will give you, like, exactly what to do. Because if you base all the things off emotions, I will say, like, before I started the program, I'm excited. So I'm super motivated.\n\nAs you start sending, you might not get results right away, so you might feel a little bit down. But then you have to look at the metrics. Are you getting opens? Are you getting replies?\n\nAnd you can rely on that data, not necessarily tied to revenue. And the important thing too is that the like, when you grow, you're not only growing in revenue, you can grow in other ways. Your your team can grow. You can learn different things.\n\nAnd you as an entrepreneur will continue to grow and and learn different skills.\n\nBut I think even now, like, when we hit fifty k, the emotional side still kicks in. And then I have to take a step back and look at the data. That way it gives you some kind of metric to look for and see where to go from there.\n\nIt's it's super easy to rely on on your emotions.\n\nSo outside of the agency, I'm also in the army, and a lot of the training kinda coincides too. A lot of the training processes in the army, as you can imagine, they're kinda emotionless. So, like, when you're tired, sleepy, hungry, don't wanna be there, you can just follow these step by step things based off the data that's in front of you and then make a decision. And you wanna kinda approach business the same way.\n\nJust read all the data. If you don't know what decision to make next, it's because you don't have enough data. So you look at the metrics. And if you're lost, programs like EasyGrow, you can just reach out to the coaches or post in the community and rely on other people for input.\n\nAt end of the day, when you reach out for input, you're just getting more data. So if you don't know what to do next, just get more data and then make a decision is the way I can approach it.\n\nIt sounds it sounds so simplistic, and people watching this will probably think, is that it? It's like, yeah.\n\nWell, at the core of it, it's literally when we have data, we can understand where your bottlenecks are immediately.\n\nAnd, you know, you know this as well, Alex. With every outreach system we have, we've got metric tracking sheets, key KPIs that we wanna look for, and key, you know, different types of data that will help us understand what the problems are. And, you know, with with some situations, if you're running outbound, any form of outreach, whether it's outbound or inbound, if you're running it blind without data, right, whether it's for yourself or for your clients, you're not gonna be able to, you know, do anything. You might have a lucky break where you've signed a couple of clients, but you won't know how you actually done that.\n\nSo you can't replicate the success. So, yeah, that's good to know that you actually benefited, you know, specific specifically from the heavy overload of data. I know that you're probably you're probably sick to death by the amount of data that you've probably looked at from all the different process that we have. So, yeah, that's good.\n\nAnd, you know, I'm curious to know, Alex, from your perspective because, you know, as you've already said yourself, you've used, you know, the the group. You've used their content. You've also gone on, you know, coaching calls. Like, I've seen you myself on the rare coaching calls I've hosted.\n\nAnd what would you say, like, are your sort of favorite parts of the program, and what specifically benefited you and your situation, would you say?\n\nYeah. I think my favorite part so I joined other programs before. I I don't wanna name them here, but, the founders of those programs, they're either late or they, like, just don't show up to their own coaching calls, and they just put in other coaches to replace them. But here, Charlie and Beau, the founders of Easy Grow, they're actually there on Monday and Friday, and they actually, like, remember your business, I guess.\n\nSo when I first run the program, I asked them a question. Next week, I I came on the program, asked them a question. And, like, Charlie and Beau, they kinda, like they're more personable. So they actually remember the context beforehand, and they're like, oh, you're the guy that does the t shirt business or whatever it is right now.\n\nI'm like, yeah. So they remember the context, and it feels more personable.\n\nAnd it's really nice to get in proximity of an entrepreneur that's doing, like, eight figures.\n\nAgain, the other pro other other programs, when the founders are at that level, like, eight figures, they don't wanna hop on to the coaching calls. Whereas Charlie and Bo are always on the coaching calls, and they try to answer every question. One thing that's nice about Easy Grow too is that you put the question in the chat. That way your question actually gets answered. Other programs, you raise your hand, and maybe when two guys get their questions answered, everyone else is just listening in.\n\nSo that's my favorite thing about Easy Grow that the founder's on time, and your question actually gets answered. And if you can't make the coaching call, you can post in the community and tag the coach, and then they can answer your question there.\n\nYep. Great stuff. Yeah. It's funny because, you mentioned that the fact that all the founders are on the call and the founders are on time. In my head, I'm thinking, is that is that really the favorite thing, Alex? Isn't that supposed to be the bare minimum?\n\nSo yeah. Because I I've been I've been a part of, you know, programs similar to it's exactly what you described where you are part of coaching calls, but there's no structure to it. However, the founder's not there, and there's no clear order. So you're listening to one person ramble on.\n\nAnd it's just that, like, a hands up system. So whereas with our one, it's just, you know, questions in the chat. We're gonna go over each issue one by one. And as you mentioned, Alex, it's personable.\n\nAnd I think, that sort of ref is a reflection on, sort of, you know, our our values here where we we take sort of every sign up genuinely seriously. Like, I I I'm a you know, you know me. I handle support in the group. I've had some calls as well, the coaching calls.\n\nI'm aware of different people's situations.\n\nAnd it's not it's not as if, you know, I do my job, but that's it. I completely forget about you. And, you know, that person who touch is really important because like you said, it goes a long way for as from a client experience because you're like, wow. These guys genuinely do care.\n\nIt's not just a matter of them taking my money, and they just you know, apologies for swearing in advance, half assing, you you know, support. So, yeah, love that, man. Love that. Alex, I'm actually curious to know, because I think you did mention my cold email as one of the systems you use to, sort of, you know, generate appointments.\n\nWere there any other specific strategies that helped you, you know, generate appointments, meetings? And was there anything else like the, you know, like the sales training that was of value to you? It'd be great to understand what other areas would would that you actually used, to get your agency to the point where it is now.\n\nYeah. And before we get into that too, I meant to mention for the coaches, other coaching programs, they have a lot of coaches, but the quality of the coaching isn't as high. So Easy Grow's coaches are usually part of the staff where they have a lot of credibility. On the program that I hopped on, there is a, like, service delivery coach, like Jimmy Mitchell.\n\nHe is the service delivery coach here, and he's run his agency for, like, years, and he does a hundred k plus. Hold on, Jimmy. Yeah. Exactly.\n\nUncle Jimmy.\n\nBut the other programs, I joined their coaching calls, and, like, the coach hasn't been passing ten k a month. And I'm like, I don't know if I want you helping me right now with these ads, which, I mean, the information might be really good, but it's just the credibility isn't there. See, I don't know if I rely on that information as much.\n\nBut for the other material in Easy Grow, one other thing too was my sales calls were all over the place. So when I first joined the calls, I just, like, rushed to get booked appointments. As soon as I got booked appointments, I was like, alright. I can sell.\n\nSo I hopped on the call, and then I realized there's no structure to the call. So it's hard to replicate your results over and over again. So I just took each call, and each call is, like, completely different. And then my close rate was really low.\n\nI didn't track any of these numbers.\n\nAnd I was trying to figure out what was wrong. So then I went to the sales modules and I just so they give you their script, but you can't just copy their script because it's not gonna work for your business. So it's the same thing again where you take that script and you modify it. So what I did was I took their script. I modified it to my niche. So I know a lot of keywords and terms that I picked up from my specific niche, and I added it to our sales script.\n\nOne thing too is their sales process is very clear on, basically, you're not even supposed to close anybody. First guy diagnosed the issue and see if they even qualify. And then if you think you can truly help them, it's almost on you that you have to help them. Like, if you're a doctor that can help a blind man see, and and if you don't wanna help him, that's, like, almost on you.\n\nSo you gotta see if you can help the person. And then if you can help them, then you can use the sales techniques and and tactics that they teach you to convince that person to drag them over the line. So that's my favorite thing. Like, each program teaches sales a little bit differently, but I like Charlie's, way of selling.\n\nIt's very ethical, and I think it matches my style.\n\nYeah.\n\nAdditionally, in the sales SOPs, they give you, like, their actual SOPs. So we took those and just copy and pasted those sheets and those metrics. And since they're metrics, those you can actually copy and paste and just put that into your business.\n\nKey key KPIs. Yeah. That's it. That's it.\n\nSo yes. So so the sales process was really helpful, and then they also have agency service delivery modules. So, basically, anything I needed I, like, I didn't go on YouTube for, like, three months because everything I needed was an easy grow, and I could just look it up and find it in there. But that's basically how I approached the the program.\n\nYeah. Love it. So it's like you just got value from different areas where it's like, alright. I'm gonna get some stuff from the email side of things to copy and stuff like this.\n\nBoom. Let's get that working. Sales stuff. Let me dig in here.\n\nService delivery. Can we check out uncle Jimmy's stuff or, you know, calls, I mean, then the stuff in the program. So, yeah, that's another thing. It just covers all bases, and it's nice where, from your experience, it sounds like once you figured out one problem, you're able to find some the next problem and just solve it from the course immediately.\n\nMhmm. Yeah. And if you don't know, you can just post in the community or ask the coaches.\n\nThat's it. That's it. Perfect, man. And, you know, I wanted to ask, what would your sort of advice be to, you know, to sort of students where, or to not even existing students, but just people in general, that want to achieve, you know, the level of success that you've got, Alex. Like, what characteristics, skills, traits would they would they need to have? Because, you know, obviously, you've picked up some really good skills and stuff from our program, and it'd be great to hear your perspective on that, especially those struggling as well. Mhmm.\n\nYeah. The way, I really like the way Charlie puts it, and it's not that it's it's in business, it's kinda you have to become the person who can is is kinda like the the motto of of easy grow.\n\nSo if you're not making, like, a hundred thousand dollars a month right now, it's it's not really outside of it's like you're not the person that has the skills to do so yet, or you don't know the information that you need to or you don't know the people to get to that level.\n\nSo for me, if I were to, like, restart the program, at first, I did expect it to be easy, but you kinda realize that anything worthwhile is really hard.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo I would expect it to be really hard, and then I would rely on the the inputs. So there's, like, five videos about systems.\n\nFor for when you're trying to do something, the output, the result itself is really hard to control, but you can control the inputs. So if you set up a list of things to do every day and you just do those things and you do that every single day, you'll start to pick up momentum and pick up results. And if you don't, you can just go into one of the coaching programs.\n\nBut I think the biggest thing for me is becoming the person who is deserving of that whatever revenue goals you might have, and just learning the skills that you need to basically generate the revenue. Because at the end of the day, you're solving problems for other business owners. That was one thing I didn't really understand too at first in terms of deliverability. Like so for the niche I was in before, we print a t shirt.\n\nSo you gave us money. We gave you your logo on a t shirt. That was very clear. For me, when I entered the marketing world, I'm like, what are we doing?\n\nSo at first, I was like, okay. I'll get you clients. But you realize each little business has their own way to get clients. Not every business is the same.\n\nSo it took me a while to learn what you're actually delivering. So I guess if I were to restart the program, what I would do is exactly the same way I did it, get those appointments set, learn sales, and then once you get a few clients, then learn the service delivery. You don't wanna spend too much time learning everything at once. So I'd learn, implement, learn, implement, because then the next problem kinda arises. If you learn how to do service delivery right away, you'll find that the service delivery that you created won't even match the problems that you're you're coming up with. I'm not sure if that makes sense.\n\nNo. No. I I completely agree. It's like you what you just described there is if you're trying to, learn things about a hundred k problems when you have one k problems, it just it doesn't make sense. Like, you need to approach it piece by piece, almost level by level like a video game. Even like yourself, Alex, where you've grown from a zero to, you know, forty k per month, now you're progressing beyond that. Right?\n\nYou know, it's just different levels and new problems. And if you were to learn everything at zero, you wouldn't be, going anywhere. So yeah.\n\nYeah. I will say the first, like, ten thousand is also the hardest.\n\nLike Yeah.\n\nCompletely the hardest because you have, like, no other resources.\n\nOne thing that I'm still learning is you can kinda pay your way out of doing things. So if you don't wanna take sales calls, once you're good enough at getting booked appointments, you can bring in a closer. If all you wanna do is do sales, then you can bring in someone to help you with the service delivery. Yeah.\n\nBut, yeah, it kinda comes down to having those systems and the metrics, though. So I I will say, when you're by yourself, it's kinda easy because you have an idea what's going on with everything. Once you start hiring team members, you need those metrics so you can get a pulse on how each part of the business is doing. Yeah. So I basically just copied all the metrics trackers from Easy Grow and put into my business.\n\nThat's it. Perfect, man. So, yeah, we're we've we've gone over, like, revenue, wise for the business, Alex. How I'm curious as to know what the structure of your sort of company looks right now compared to how it was before.\n\nLike, what was the you know, do you have a team now? Do you have, like, you know, different people managing different peep different things? What does it, what does it look like? Yeah.\n\nSo right now, when I first started, it was just myself, and I was in the process of running my print shop at the same time. I'll say in, like honestly, it was in December when I finalized the sale and sold off all my equipment. It was not a fancy exit. I just liquidated my equipment. Honestly, I had a loss. But I was just by myself, and then I first hired as a VA to kinda take off those tasks. There's a quote that I heard is that if you don't have an assistant, you are the assistant.\n\nSo the first thing I did was I made my schedule for the day, and I looked at the task I had, and I handed those off to the virtual assistant. So things like lead scraping, setting up those outbound systems. If you have those SOPs in place, which you can copy and paste from Easy Grow because the SOPs are very similar, you can hand it off to somebody else. But my team right now, we have two VAs to help out with the service delivery, and then we're onboarding a client success manager to help me with the fulfillment and onboarding on the back end. And then we have one closer on the front end, and that's our structure right now. In between when I first started till now, we hired white label agencies. We tried three or four different white label agencies.\n\nWe had different ISAs. So the team grows and shrinks. But right now, it's two VAs, one, almost like an ops manager to kind of remove myself from the fulfillment, and then we have a closer on the front end.\n\nYeah. Love it, man. And you literally came into this, as a one man army.\n\nLiterally just hand handling it yourself, and now you're in a position where, you know, you you've got, like, a mini team in place, and you're sort of transitioning into that space where you're trying to be a top quality recruiter so you'd be able to scale to the next part, which is what a lot of people struggle with because they're so good at being a business owner, but then it's time to be a recruiter to truly, you know, get to seven figures and beyond. So, yeah, great stuff.\n\nWhat would you say, Alex, would be your your goals moving forward, with with the business. It'd be good to understand, you know, get a pulse check on that and, you know, the the direction you wanna take things in.\n\nYes. So that's a good question, Noor. Right now, we're in a weird stage of pivoting. So in January, we had so many book calls. Like, if we really wanted to and gas it, I think we woulda hit a hundred k at the rate we're going.\n\nBut our service delivery, kinda was broken on the back end, and I wanna make sure we have a really good product.\n\nSo if it's it's kinda like that analogy where if you wanna build the fastest tower and and you have, like, ten minutes to build it, you only can build it so far.\n\nSo what I realized is whatever you build now, it's gonna break. And my philosophy was, like, just break it as fast as we can. So we built something like a really small minimal viable product. We built the system, and then we broke the system. Built the system, break the system. So right now, we're in that period of of building. So from fifty k a month, we kinda took a pause, and we're like, we wanna make sure everyone gets really good results.\n\nAnd then what I did was I systematized the fulfillment.\n\nSo I set up, like, SOPs. Like, if I onboard to someone new today, these are the steps that they have to do.\n\nSome of the mistakes I made was that I thought I can replace myself with one person.\n\nAnd, clearly, it's it's hard to put all those skills into one person, especially if you lose that person too, then you have to start over. So what we did was we effectively trained each person on one specific task, and then they take care of that task. If they leave you, you'll still be okay. You can just train somebody new.\n\nBut for our direction in the future right now is I think we're gonna take it one level higher. So right now, we're helping screen printing shops. Most of them are b to b. And now I realized, that we can help almost any b to b business and get them more b to b leads.\n\nMost recently, in our industry, we can help the screen printers, but there's also people who manufacture machines for these printers.\n\nSo I've been getting approached by different companies actually to help them with their marketing. And their machines the smallest machine they have is, like, fifty thousand dollars, and they're, like, an enterprise company. So their budget is, like, almost through the roof.\n\nFor them to hire a marketing agency like myself, it's actually way cheaper for them to hire, like, a marketing director who probably doesn't know how to run Facebook ads or do any of that kind of stuff.\n\nSo most recently, we signed a deal with a with a equipment manufacturing company. So I realized our first pivot was going from brick and mortars to online businesses, helping b two b. And then now we realize we can move up market towards bigger b two b companies. Because right now, we're getting book calls for screen printing.\n\nSo if you want, like, that's I feel that's pretty hard, getting people to get book calls for custom T shirt printing. It's actually even easier to do it for, like, a different type of company. So now moving forward, we're restructuring our service delivery. We're also So that's, like, the best part.\n\nSo that's why the first ten k is so difficult. You have to take on everybody, even if they're bad clients, good clients. You kinda sell everybody. But once you get to a certain point, you can get rid of the bad clients and focus on the good clients.\n\nAnd you'll realize that the good clients, they pay you more and they take less time to manage, and they actually get better results too because they're also good business owners.\n\nSo that'll be one of the biggest things I realized. It's not hard forever. It gets a little bit easier. Yeah.\n\nThat's it. Amazing, man. And, I love the point you made about how you said, yeah, we could have scaled this to the moon to a hundred k per month.\n\nThat would have made for a a great interview title. But at the same time, from a business perspective, it won't be the right move because, you know, operationally, yeah, you'd have the fancy Stripe account that'll just you can flash, and that number's gone in one month if without proper operations. So, yeah, that's a that's a fantastic, like, business decision from your end, Alex, to just sort of maintain what you're doing and, you know, work on systems and and things like this, which you already spoke about, you know, before we before even the the call. But, yeah, that's that's fantastic.\n\nAnd another point I like is what you made about the pivot side of thing where it's like, yes. You got b two b, you know, printed companies. You've got a proof of concept here. But then the the framework you have, it can be applicable to other markets.\n\nAnd more import more more specifically, you found an alternative market that's linked to, you know, T shirt printing in some way with the machine specifically. So it's fantastic, man. And, yeah, I'm curious to see, you know, what the future looks like for you. And I'm excited because I I, obviously, run the operations for, you know, easy growth.\n\nSo what really makes me happy is whenever I see a student or a client like yourself, for example, they say, hey, man. Gonna Gonna pause things that I'm fixing up at the back end. I'm like, yes. This is this is a big win.\n\nForget forget more and more clients because I've seen situations where people just scale up ridiculously fast.\n\nThey're without a proper team, without proper fulfillment, Alex, and it's just ego driven. They want the number. They think it's quick cash, but it's just not sustainable. So, yeah, really good stuff, and that's good to know about your future plan in that regard. And I wanna before we sort of finish up the the interview, Alex, one question I I wanna ask is, you know, how has the growth in the business sort of affected your, your personal life? Because we spoke just before, you know, we started recording this interview.\n\nBusiness owners, they tend to be locked in. They get into the Formula one car. They zoom it's like that man in the arena quote. They're in the arena.\n\nThey don't care about anything else. They just keep on fighting and fighting and fighting, and they don't realize their progression and and how far they've actually come. So I'd love to hear your perspective on, you know, how life has changed, if it did change significantly before you started this business. But, yeah, it'd be great to hear your perspective on how things have changed for you.\n\nYeah. No. That's a really good question.\n\nBefore I started, we had we had the printing business, but say, like, the revenue was, like, sixty k. Our lease or rent was already, like, eight k. Equipment financing was a bunch of money. Labor, insurance, taxes on payroll, everything was American labor, so that was super expensive.\n\nAnd then we had cost of goods. So say, like, we made sixty k that month. My profit margin was, like, three, four thousand. At the end of the day, I'm like, this this kinda blows.\n\nSo once I go over to that business, also, I hated printing T shirts.\n\nA lot of people didn't know that. But when I was talking to Seb, which is the salesperson who I was talking to when I first joined Easy Grow, he was telling me, like, if you switch markets, I guarantee you you're gonna be like, you're gonna do really well. And, like, if you look at our old email chains, we almost, like, predicted where we'd end up.\n\nBut, in terms of our life, when I first joined Easy Grow, one, I was really upset with, like, printing T shirts. I really didn't like that. And two, I really wanted to learn how to do this online stuff. That way I can work wherever because I have to travel a lot for the army.\n\nSo once I got rid of that side and focus on this side, I was happier because I really like the work. The work was a lot better just sitting on a computer compared to, like, manually printing all the shirts and, like, the the air is really bad and it's super hot.\n\nIt's basically a modern sweatshop. It was it's the way way I like to put it. But once we got rid of that stuff, when I first started Easy Grow, I actually couldn't even walk, because I had training in June and July, and I hurt my ankle toward the ligaments of my ankle till I got surgery. So from August until well, that's pretty recently. I started walking again. I couldn't walk, so I just sat here at my computer and just worked on the business.\n\nThe biggest thing I I realized was, like, I was just working, like, ridiculous hours, like, fifteen, sixteen hours a day. I realized that you have to optimize your hours because at some point, you do hit burnout. I was a big guy. I'm like, dude, you can't burnout. It's, like, impossible to burnout. But at a certain point, you'll hit, like, a brick wall, and you can't really your your, production your work capacity just gets so low that's not even worth it that you're better off just taking a break, stepping back, and and lowering the hours, but making sure those hours are really, really productive.\n\nSo most recently, we actually cut back I cut back on the amount of hours we're working, and I decided to sleep more. And in return, I've been getting way more work done in less time.\n\nSo that's that's really important. The second thing too is I do feel more confident now that if, like, worst case never happened, I feel like I have the skills to at least make a baseline minimum. So for example, if I sold everything off right now, I can finally I could probably find a closer position, like, somewhere else and just sell for a different company. And my minimum income for the month would probably be at least ten thousand.\n\nSo for my life, I'm not really a big spender. But I guess the most recent thing I've done is is I got, like, a new apartment, like, a nicer apartment. Scobins.\n\nIt's, like, not a fancy, like, penthouse, but, like, a top floor of the building, and it's just by myself.\n\nAnd I can That's it.\n\nLive out there, and I'll be alright.\n\nOther than that, life hasn't changed too much other than, I guess, the person I became. Now I'm pretty confident again that if everything came, like, worse came to worse, I can just learn how I can I know how to sell now, so I can just sell for your business?\n\nI love that, man. I love that. And, you know, you said you you couldn't walk. I think I think we spoke about that, you know, on email over email about your situation.\n\nAnd it's like, maybe it was destiny for you to be at your laptop, man, in the meantime. I think you're at the business. But, no, jokes aside, like, super happy. You know, you're able to walk again, and, you know, because you got the business running whilst you're still recovering.\n\nAnd, yeah, it's amazing. Like, you know, the apartment's a big win. You had the freedom to actually upgrade your apartment. I'm sure you could have gone, an even nicer apartment, but I'm sure you're being, you know, sensible where some people just blow it, put out all their money away.\n\nBut the the part about being confident, Alex, that's such a massive win where you've got a sense of power now and control where even if your business, you know, for whatever reason, god forbid, it just disappeared, you're in a position where you've learned the skills, you know, skills, characteristics, and traits from your own experience outside of Easy Grow, but also the things you've learned throughout Easy Grow to be able to rebuild yourself, whether it's restarting the business or, like you said, tap into other opportunities from the skill set you developed. And I think that's another underrated thing that a lot of, success stories that we have, they don't realize that.\n\nLike, what you just said there where it's like, they're they actually got power. Like, they can go, hey. If I lose this, I can just easily build enough one or just tap into something else because I know how to do things. I don't I'm not relying on copying and pasting things.\n\nI understand, you know, the frameworks and principles behind, you know, the things I actually do. So, yeah, that that's fantastic. And it's always great to hear, you know, not just like the the materialistic wins where, obviously, people get some money. You know, they they buy some nice things.\n\nThey look after their family, which is amazing.\n\nBut I love hearing the identity shift wins as well where you're a much more confident person now, and that translates to, you know, all areas of your life, and that just comes from having the sense of power. So, yeah, good stuff, man. So final question for you, Alex.\n\nAs you're aware, people are gonna be watching this interview, probably existing students, but also people that aren't a customer of the program yet. And, naturally, they just want to hear, you know, other students' perspective on the program.\n\nWhat would you say to someone that is on the fence about, you know, joining the program? Because I'm sure perhaps when you, you know, were looking into the program itself, you may have had reservations naturally, right, or questions.\n\nWhat would you say to that person out there that's watching this interview that's, you know, thinking about it and, is on defense as to whether this may or may not be a good fit for them?\n\nYeah. No. That's a great question. I guess we'll start with, like, the worst things that I didn't like about Easy Grow.\n\nI guess at first, it's like there's so much information that's given to you at once that you almost feel lost.\n\nSo if you aren't, like, willing to work, I guess like, some people expect when you buy the course, that's, like, the win and that they don't have to do anything. Like, that's the sense of accomplishment.\n\nSo I wouldn't buy the course if you don't want to put in the the work and expect fast cash.\n\nI wouldn't wanna buy it if you're not actually trying to solve someone's issues and you just wanna sell. Yep. One of the big things, especially from the coaches here, is that you actually wanna deliver good results. Yeah. I've joined other programs where all they've preached is just sell, sell, sell. Like, it doesn't really matter, about the back end. So that's what I liked about Easy Grow.\n\nIt was actually Charlie and Mort Charlie and, and Bo actually told me to pause client acquisition when I got to the point where I was at. So I think that's a a big testimonial for for the person they are. They're like, yeah. I mean, if you want client acquisition, I showed them the numbers, and they said, like, your client acquisition really isn't the issue right now. Like, you might as well just pause client acquisition. They said they probably never recommend that to anybody else.\n\nBut they told me to work on the product side. So, that's why I paused client acquisition. But if you're looking to join a program or you want everything in one place, I think Easy Grow is the easiest place to do it. I will say that it's not done for you. Like, you have to do the work yourself.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat's probably the the biggest thing. But if you are willing to do the work and you are willing to learn and you're willing to try new things and really put in the volume, it's kinda like joining the gym. Like, no matter what gym you join, if you don't work out, you're not gonna get the results.\n\nSo that's the type of person you have to be if you wanna join this program. But if you are willing to put in the work and you're willing like, you just want the step by step instructions on how to do everything, then I would do it. And if you ever get lost, reach out to, like, Noor. I I believe I've reached out to Noor a few times when I like, there's just so so, like, way too much information. I don't know where to go.\n\nYou can always post into the community. That's my favorite thing. But, yes, if you're on the fence here and your only reservation is that you don't know if you'll get results, the guarantee is is really powerful.\n\nAnd there's just so much information on the back end.\n\nI will say I'm trying to think of the bad things in the program so that I can lay everything out, but it it's really hard to identify bad things. Again, the only bad thing I would say is that there's so much at once almost that you kinda get lost. Yeah.\n\nAnd, and if not done for you, you have to do the work.\n\nThat's Of course. Very clear that you have to put in the work.\n\nBut, yeah, again, if you're willing to put in the work, I think easy grow is probably the best program Yeah. That I've been into. It just covers all bases. It gives you basically every issue that you might run into. And what I also really like about Easy Grow is that they continue to add more programs.\n\nYep.\n\nI think that just kinda shows who they are too. Most recently, like, Charlie posted saying, like, how can I make this better for you? Yeah. And other programs don't do that at all. Since I joined Easy Grow, there's been two or three new modules that came out. There's, like, probably double the number of coaching calls, so the program continues to to grow. Yeah.\n\nSo, yeah, I guess long story short, if you're willing to put in the work, just join Easy Grow, and you'll grow pretty quick as long as you're willing to do in the work.\n\nIf you're if you're lazy, you don't wanna do it, then I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nYeah. I I love the transparency, man. Even, like, the negative of how there's so much in there. It can be overwhelming.\n\nNaturally but then, you know, it's one of those ones where, like you mentioned, Alex, that's where the group support is. That's where the coaching calls are. Yes. You gotta do it yourself.\n\nYou know, you gotta go through the program yourself, but we like to call it a done with you solution because you got us. You got us in the group. You got us in coaching calls where you can speak to us directly. You've done it yourself, Alex, where, you know, you can attest to this.\n\nYou aren't just flying solo.\n\nAny questions you needed, it was covered. And, yeah, so so I'll rebuttal that to anyone watching who will be overwhelmed with information.\n\nI can say you probably will, but in a good way. And, you know, we we still have this, Alex. It's funny that you mentioned where you get the odd student that goes, I don't know where to start. It's like, hey.\n\nLet let me know what your issues are, and then I could point you in the right direction. Because similar to you, Alex, you're just using the search bar, and you just went bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, got it solved. So yeah. And then the other point you raised, it's people willing to work, like you mentioned, perfect fit for the program.\n\nI I'm we're we're all very blunt, and I'm not just saying that from personal standpoint because I because I'm British and, you know, British people tend to be quite blunt and straightforward. But, you know, I'm not gonna package this as something as, you come in the program, and that's that immediate success. Like, Alex is a perfect example of this where, you know, he's grafted. He's I see him in coaching calls.\n\nI see him in in the group. He's had years of experience in business before but he still had to put in the work. So as Alex mentioned, you know, if you're on the fence by your someone that's willing to work and you just need to understand what you wanna work on, we can help with that. But like Alex also put it, if you're someone that doesn't wanna put in the work, then there there there's probably other solutions better for you, instead of this.\n\nBut yeah. Perfect, man. Really, really good to know.\n\nKnow that, Alex, and I'm sure, you know, the people watching this would appreciate that, especially those that are on the fence. But, yeah, that's pretty much it for the interview. Everyone that's watching this, you know, if you are open to learning more about the program, feel free to just, you know, book a call, and you can find out if you're a good fit for it. Alternatively, you know, you can check out the other interviews that we have on the website, and just check out Charlie's YouTube channel as well because that is where you'll get, a bit of a taste of the type of, you know, value that we bring and what we actually teach.\n\nSo, yeah, that's pretty much it for the interview. Alex, thank you so much, man. And to everyone watching, I hope you enjoyed it. We'll catch you another time.\n\nCheers.\n\nBye. Yep."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}}, {});
