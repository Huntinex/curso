How is it going, man? It's been a long time since I brought you on. And, honestly, it's been quite a while since I last saw you. I last saw you at the at the mastermind, But, we will we will dive into all of this juicy stuff in a second. I guess, really, first things first, perhaps you can give an introduction of who you are, what it is you do, and what your current monthly reoccurring revenue is and all of that type of good stuff.\n\nCool. So, I used to I used to. I run an agency here called Buizon Studios. We basically have property developers brand market launch and sell into the market.\n\nThat's how it was when I originally started. Right? When when you met me, I had the agency. Yep.\n\nRight? And we sort of before we used to do everything, we used to serve every niche, do every market, do every different type of product. And as soon as we joined the program, the first thing we got sorted out was our offer, figured out what clients we wanted to to work with, and that completely changed the way we work because we're able to offer a much better product. Like I said, work with just property developers launching residential projects into the market.\n\nAnd what we also managed to do is increase profitability like crazy because we knew exactly how to solve the problem exactly, like, making sure that the the product we're selling to our clients was as as top as possible. And we saw the results of that tenfold over. Like, I just closed the deal yesterday of fifty k just just like that because just because, like, people just come to us now when we're like, in my market, especially from where I'm from in Musa, anyone who has a development on the island just comes straight to us. Like, we don't even do any marketing really to it anymore.\n\nWe just promote the products product the products we've done and the projects we've worked on. But now it's just like, it's stupid for someone else not to work with us because we have so much experience and so much results in that specific niche. So Beautiful. Besides, like, like, that that besides the acquisition strategies you shared with us in the access school and Charlie has gone through and all of that, it's just, like, just helped us really hone in into what we wanted to do best, giving the best product and, like, being able to scale that side of it.\n\nFantastic. So how much how much is the business doing at the moment monthly?\n\nNow we're doing around fifty k a month, but, like, profitability wise, tenfold to what we used to do before. Like, we used to hardly any profits in Israel, like, ten percent, fifteen percent. Now our markups, our profit margins are much or way, way higher, like, fifty to sixty percent per project, which is which is much better for us. But at the same time, while that's running and I sort of we're not really I hired the creative director for that. I hired the whole team and built out the whole thing with regards to running the agency side. I'm not that involved in it anymore. I just do sales calls and just the sales meetings.\n\nAnd then through the mastermind, that completely changed my life, man.\n\nYeah. We're we're gonna dive into all of that. So just so just to give everybody some context to our home, the first time that Sam and I had a conversation was all the way back in twenty twenty two. It was right at the end of twenty twenty two. If I remember correctly, at that point in time, you were more focused just purely on web design and web development. I don't even think you'd made the transition into lead generation as as of yet.\n\nWe never had done any lead generation, to be honest.\n\nYep.\n\nAnd so what I think the the thing that you were trying to accomplish at that point in time is how do you transition how to go about, as you said, you know, getting the right offer in place, picking out the right completely forgot about that, man.\n\nTo be honest, it's like, our business is so legion now. It's like I completely forgot what we've met. I wasn't even doing any lead gen. It was just web.\n\nSo, like, now our product is what we said is we guarantee our clients that they get at least fifty qualified buyer leads every single month. Like, that's we don't even sell websites anymore. Our website is just, like, part of what we're selling and part of our process. But our offer now is, like, we're gonna get you leads, but to get you these qualified leads, we're gonna build you up your brand.\n\nWe're gonna build your website. We're gonna build your marketing. We're gonna be your CRM.\n\nLike, I forgot about that completely, to be honest.\n\nIt's crazy. It's crazy.\n\nIt might be hard to remember this because, again, you you've been with us for a long time. You've really seen the the progression, not only of Imperium, but also of Charlie. Like, if I remember, again, you came in through, the YouTube channel. This was back when Charlie had, like, I don't know, four thousand subscribers, not a hundred thousand subscribers.\n\nBut, with all of this in mind, like, what was it about Charlie even at that point in time that that attracted you to to to booking a call?\n\nI think it was just what he was saying. Like, the content he was giving away, he and he like, everything that I was going through, he was sort of pinpointing out in in his YouTube videos, to be honest. He was giving so much advice on, like, how to generate leads, how to book more appointments, how to close more deals. And we didn't really have that much as an agency.\n\nSo just hearing how he what process he had and the systems he had, it didn't just sound believable. It just sounded like this is exactly what I need, and this is exactly what's missing in my business. So it was just like, we have the product down. We thought we did.\n\nWe didn't. We learned that once we joined the program, but it was more of, like, his knowledge and expertise and just, like, showing us exactly what he needed to be done really and truly.\n\nAnd had you done any had you done any courses before that point in time?\n\nNo. I almost bought Imangadji's course. I thought it didn't, to be honest.\n\nAnd I paid, like, six grand to a sales company to try help us solve, like, go international and solve our sales problem, but that's like, we had zero results from that. We did we just throw away our money? Because we had someone doing outreach through email. We got zero leads.\n\nBut it wasn't even their fault to do this because we didn't even have an offer. We were just like, we're a web design a to z. Yeah. Like, I started realizing why we're going to the course and over the past two years, like, most of the things weren't working was because of our fault alone.\n\nWe just didn't have the knowledge to actually know how to scale it from our end.\n\nI think that's one thing that Charlie does really well is he helps you to realize that it's not just a specific piece of copy. It's not just gonna be a subject line that gets you there. Like, it's really the whole thing. You have to have the whole thing in place.\n\nYou can fire off a thousand emails a day if you want, but it doesn't mean you're gonna get any appointments.\n\nMan for good.\n\nBut taking it back to that point, because you you've been involved, in the previous product.\n\nYou were involved when it was just Imperium, agency prior to to Easy Grow, and then, obviously, you saw the transition into Yeah.\n\nI think it was, like, a month what differences have you seen, like, as time has gone by in terms of the products?\n\nThe program. Nothing bad. Just constant. Like, every other month, there's something new being added. I I jumped in back because I'm not really in the program anymore. Like, we we got exactly what we needed out of it, came to the mastermind.\n\nAnd jumping back in for a for a month, I think, it was like, wow. This is like a completely new program with regards to, like, running YouTube ads, running Facebook ads, the the Facebook and Go high level setup.\n\nSo the great thing about it is what I've implemented into my business now is just, like, constantly improving the the product and the iterations of the product, which is which is huge.\n\nAnd I I think that's, like, again, one of the biggest things that you get from Charlie is that he I think the thing that really separates him is that he's all about the product, and he makes you realize it needs to be all about the product.\n\nAnd that's probably why you're you're literally dominating your entire market right now is because Well, I believe in the same way, to be honest.\n\nLike, we didn't do any marketing, and we were kind of successful. We're doing, like, thirty k months, forty k months without doing zero marketing. This is just solely based on our product and our process working. So, like, going into the program and seeing how dedicated he was to the product and constantly evolving it just made me apply it even more, like, double down on that from our end as well. Like, the lead gen can work. You can get as many leads as you want. You can make as many sales as you want, but really and truly, for me, if there's more product than than product first and then going into that afterwards, just help me, like, be where I am today really and truly, I I feel.\n\nYou you talked about profit profitability.\n\nRight? Why why do you feel like, the product kind of helped you to maybe figure out some of those cakes?\n\nAnd biggest thing was just sort of finding one niche because we used to do everything for everyone. One day, we're doing an ecommerce site. One day, we're doing a restaurant's website. Another day, we're doing a hotel's website.\n\nAnd it's like, some projects are gonna fail. Some projects are gonna be do well. But what we've sort of put together was we have we would realize, like, okay. What's our best client here? Like, where are we making the most money? Who are we seeing the most results with?\n\nAnd doing the first chapter through the through the course, through school was, like, too easy to grow. I allowed us sort of to figure that out. Like, what is our offer? Who are we trying to serve?\n\nSo, like, now we're just serving property developers mainly, and that just allowed us to, like, okay. It's just this, this, this, and this every single time. There's no, like, hiccups. There's no, like, nothing we didn't expect to happen.\n\nWe are the authority once the client comes to us, and they listen to us because we've done it a hundred times before.\n\nWhereas before, it's like, okay. We need to start from the beginning here. We need to come up with a whole new strategy. We need to understand your business. We need to it never really worked because every time it's some completely different strategy, a a completely bit different problem you're trying to solve. And it's like, how are you expected to to improve your product if you don't have, like, one problem you're solving?\n\nMhmm. That makes sense.\n\nThat's the biggest thing for us, I would say, when it came to profitability because now it's like the process is one, two, three, four, five. We know exactly how to do it. We know exactly what works and what doesn't work. We spent thousands on ads to figure out what ads work as well for that niche. Yep. So clients are much happier because the results are much better every single time.\n\nBecause they're predictable because you've done that. You've done it over and over again.\n\nExactly. And we know that the next product is gonna be even better than once more because we're Yeah. The problems already. So it's great.\n\nAnd and that's why it's so important to just do one thing, really to just do one thing. Okay. Alright. Cool. So so beyond that, you were also talking about the offer, etcetera. What what would you say were your your biggest takeaways from the program? I'm sure that it's kind of changed as time has gone by, but what are, like, the key things that you really think moved the needle for you massively to help you get to that fifty k?\n\nI think it was just understanding outreach and how it all works because we had sent out thousands of emails before. We had tried cold calling. We had tried approaching. Nothing ever worked.\n\nRight? We sent out emails to you to Damak, which is the biggest property developer in Dubai. Right? And this this CMO, the top marketing manager of the company replied back to one of our emails because we're like, this is our offer.\n\nThis is what we can do. Okay. We didn't lead into our sale because we weren't ready for it.\n\nMhmm. But, like, I'd never thought cold outreach would work with regards to emails, and we got replies from some of the biggest companies in the world, the biggest property developer in the world replying back to one of the emails we sent out.\n\nThat's a cold email.\n\nAnd was this using the the Loom strategy?\n\nNo. Without the loans. Okay.\n\nBecause we fed the loan for for high end luxury.\n\nIt might have been a bit too, like, not work as well. So this is like, this is our offer. This who this will have helped. We want some of, like, massive international design awards from our end, from a web design point of view. So our our emails and our offer was very strong with regards to, like we've worked with projects on the likes of Zaha Hadid Architects, which are some of the biggest architectural fab in the world. We've won international design awards for the work we've done.\n\nSo our offer was quite strong when it comes to, like, this is who we are, this is how we can help you, and we could guarantee you sort of. We had a look at your website, and we can guarantee an increase in your convert you.\n\nSo from what from what I'm understanding, you feel like the reason why this was effective this time around before you you kind of jumped on board was because you knew who you need to talk to, and you had an offer that spoke perfectly to that market.\n\nExactly. Because then that applies to ads. It applies to your code outreach. It applies to anything else.\n\nSo like that for me, that was the key. It's like, fuck. Now I understand how business works. Like, why would anyone say, I used to run ads before as an agency and say, listen.\n\nWork with us. We do web development. It's like, now I feel stupid looking at what I used to put out as an ad because, like, what the hell is gonna click on that anyway? I mean, it's not speaking.\n\nIt's not calling out to anyone. It's not speaking to anyone.\n\nIt's a shotgun approach, and you're just hoping that something is gonna stick.\n\nI know it's gonna stick to that, so that was that was the biggest thing for us.\n\nOkay. Cool. Let's let's talk about the mastermind then. So, I think, actually, Charlie posted a video from the mastermind on the YouTube channel, like, a couple of days ago. We decided to come over for the mastermind. Why why was that?\n\nBecause the program really, I don't know, changed my life with regards to the program because it was solving my biggest problems I had. It was like, how am I ever gonna get more leads? And the results we got out of it sort of had so much of an impact in my business life and my life as well. It's like, okay, man.\n\nI want to learn more about how I can scale this faster, how I can scale this differently. And to be honest, I come from a place where there's not much happening here, like, with my friends and sort of in my country with regards to agencies and sort of scaling. So being around Charlie and the team and learning from you guys was something that was exciting for me. So I said, let's do it.\n\nI mean, I I made them I made that six k back within the first month of joining of joining the program. Right? So I was like, listen. If I if I double my money within the first month of joining, what's gonna happen if I have, like, one on one of him looking at into our business and then sort of Charlie giving us advice and guiding us to it also?\n\nI jumped on the idea straight away.\n\nAnd what would you say were some of your key takeaways from the the mastermind? Because I know by the sounds of things for you, you've decided to stay with the agency model.\n\nI know a part of the mastermind was more focused on showing people how to That's that's that's the big thing.\n\nSo Okay. The agency is running itself now. And now my whole model for myself is I just do sales for the agency with regards to property developers. And now I have around, I did thirty thirty five k in sales in just program and course training with regards to I train real estate agents.\n\nBasically, easy grow Mhmm.\n\nBut for real estate agents.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo we have have we got two separate revenue streams here, or is this is this combined fifty k? So we got the fifty k we got the fifty k on the agency, and then we've got the thirty five coming in from the course as well.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And that's it. That's growing in the month. That's, like, I'm just dialing in my my ad, so it's good.\n\nGood job, Sam. Okay. Let's let's let's explore this in more detail then.\n\nBecause, obviously, I I think a lot of you didn't really know what to expect when when we No.\n\nNo idea. Into the mastermind.\n\nExactly. It was a bit of a thing on the first day where Charlie was like, guys, all of you are experienced. All of you know what you're doing. You've got expertise.\n\nI really think it makes sense for you to start transitioning over to input product. And I I I'm sure at that point in time, it must have been like, I don't know. Does this does this really make sense?\n\nSince doing that, Sam, what are what are your thoughts? Like, do you find operationally, it's a lot simpler, you have a better quality of life?\n\nLike, what does what does that look like for you?\n\nSo before I came to the mastermind, I was really thinking about I I already had set up a bit of it with regards to, like, how it all work because I was inspired by Easygram. Like, love. This makes so much more sense. Like, rather than doing the actual work, like, agency life, training people to do themselves.\n\nSo I came there with that at the back of my head already. I already had, like, drawn out the business plan of how it all works. So when I came there, he said that. Charlie said, like, listen.\n\nWe're gonna focus on building out your own program. I'm like, this couldn't be better for me. So I went into there and came out of that. Like, it changed my life tenfold over, man.\n\nLike, to be honest, I think it is just meeting you guys and understanding how the team works and how we all inspired you are with regards to Charlie and the vision and yourself. So to me, just that alone was, like, completely changed the way I work with my team, the way I work with like, it's it's called agent leaders, the agent leaders dot com, my program. And, like, I implemented everything he said with regards to, like, building out a team, like, building out a vision. I never had that with my other comp with Bison, with the agency.\n\nBut with the agent leaders now, it's like, I know I want to go. Understanding how to build out a team that's motivated and sort of all believe in the same vision was huge to me because in an agency, we never really had that.\n\nAnd it's like now it's much more rewarding. Besides, it's much more profitable. Besides, it's a much better quality of life because you're not really implementing the things yourself.\n\nIt's so much more rewarding because I have people saying you're changing my life, man. It's like, for me, that is the biggest thing. It's like, okay. I built a new business. We're making thirty five, forty k months.\n\nBut really and truly, it's like like, the satisfaction I get from my team members seeing me as a leader now based on, like, understanding the vision, where I want to go and stuff. Being, like helping them set their goals, helping them figure out what they want to do with their lives and implementing the same things with the clients who sign up for the program is, like, seeing the feedback I get from there is, like, we're I'm I'm teaching them skills like Charlie taught us that are gonna last last a lifetime for them and, like, their understanding of their problems with with their business. So it's been like a full circle moment. It's like, okay. I started with Easy Grow. It changed my life, went to the mastermind. Now I'm doing the same thing with with my client in this stage.\n\nIt's it's kind of crazy to think about because it actually hasn't been that long. Like, it's been, what, around fourteen months. Yes. Yeah. About fourteen, fifteen months. It's really not you've gone from web design to to lead gen to consulting. And do you do you put that down to the fact that, I guess, perhaps you've had, like, a clear road map in in place to be able to follow, that you've been able to move up that speed because of that.\n\nHundred percent. Hundred percent. I would I would say, like, having like, if I didn't join the program, I would not have started this info business. I would have not have solved my problems.\n\nSo it's like even just joining the program and understanding how the easy go program was set up with go high level. I didn't even know what go high level was two years ago before I joined the program. Mhmm. So it's like, without having that, it's like is crazy.\n\nKnow. I'd be stuck in doing the same thing I've been doing for the part for the.\n\nIt's been life changing, honestly, man. Even the people I met at the mastermind. I joined Brian Moncada's mastermind as well.\n\nYeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. I I really enjoyed that as well, but it was it's this is the other thing, I think, that is so understated about being part of a community.\n\nIt's the people. It's the networking. It's the access to information that you get. It's insane.\n\nIt's insane. Okay. Well, look. Let's let's kind of future pace a little bit. Let's look to the future.\n\nYeah. What what is the goal then? Because you're running two businesses at the moment. One of them is doing fifty k.\n\nThe other is doing thirty five k. Is is the plan just to just let the agency side of things tick over, maybe prepare for an exit, and scale up the coaching business?\n\nWhat's what's the focus solely on the coaching business, really and truly, because the agency, we're just working with clients that like, we have a set process. We have a creative director there. I'm just doing sales organically that comes to us. We're not even doing any marketing or any outreach anymore.\n\nSo I'm just letting that whoever comes in and and, like, jobs around fifty k jobs for us. So for it's it's silly for us to say no. Clients are happy. We're still building up whatever we have there for the past years of work.\n\nI mean, it's so that's just running itself. So I'm not gonna I'm not focusing too much on the agency. I have a partner in the agency, but on on agent leaders, that's me completely alone.\n\nSo Do do you know what?\n\nIt's so funny that you mentioned this because I was looking back at my notes from the call.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd on the notes, it said, he wants to get started, but he needs to speak to his business partner about this, took a hundred dollar deposit. So I'm guessing it it might be that that was the business partner.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou're talking about. And it's it's scary to think. And this like, I try so hard on the sales calls for this reason. Like, it's terrifying to think if you hadn't done this, what would have happened? Like, what life would look like if you didn't come on board?\n\nI guess, on that note then, Sam, what what is the best piece of advice that you could give to somebody who's maybe, you know, jumping on a call with me, jumping on a call with one of the other reps? And they're like, I don't know. Like, I don't know if this is gonna be the right thing for me. Is is this worth me making this investment? Should I take this step? Should I take this risk? What would you say to them?\n\nI would say just if your problem is being organized lead generation, you have no stop vision of where you want to go, what you need guidance, then there's this the proof is there. Like, there's everything you need to have in the course itself. You have Charlie who's, like, doing, I don't know, millions a month with regards to revenue in the info product and in the sort of agency space as well he used to before. So it's like, if you're gonna learn from someone, there's no one else on the market, I think, that you can learn from. It's like, what I realized was instead of spending five, six years maybe finding the information I needed to find, I found it within a week of joining the program.\n\nSo, like And I think that's so powerful given how much you have done in such short period of time.\n\nBecause this is what I say to people all the time is I don't doubt that you could make it happen. Like, you can, but it just might take you three, four, five years to get there. But for you to have basically gone through three different businesses and scaled them so quickly, it's because you just have that access to the information.\n\nIt's right there to make there.\n\nLike, if you wanted, it's there. Like, you you can pay five hundred grand for something. But, I mean, if you're not gonna do the work, it's gonna be you're not gonna get anywhere. So if you're ready to do the work and if you're ready to put in and you're ready to sort of grow, then there's nowhere else you need to be.\n\nLiterally, you have every single tool you need to actually grow right in front of you. You can go to the program, and I don't know how many weeks we're gonna take you. I I have just took the pieces of information that I thought apply to my agency. Within two weeks, I was implementing everything and and changing what needed to be changed.\n\nSo it's like, rather than spending two, three years, four years, what that's what I told my business partner. I'm like, listen. If we never paid for this course, we'd be in this exact same position, hoping, like, let's run another stupid ad, and let's do another email without understanding how it's gonna work. Like, you just have information that works.\n\nSo for me, it's like, the way I think now is so different because as soon as I have a problem, I just look for someone who's solved that problem before. Yep. And Charlie has solved every single one of those problems in the COVID. So it's like, why wouldn't you pay for it?\n\nIt's it's like Okay.\n\nCool. Well, look. I guess to wrap this up, is there is there anything else that you wanna bring to the table?\n\nIs there anything else that you wanna share with people just before we before we No, man.\n\nTo be honest, I needed that too because I was feeling today was like one of those sales calls today where it's so different, like, selling the program than selling the agency work because the agency work are people are coming to us most of the time. Mhmm. They want to work with us. And now with these, I'm running guides out.\n\nSo it's been one of those days where, like, one call didn't show up. Two people Yeah. I understand. Yeah. I understand. But now what am I doing?\n\nNow I'm just realizing It's the oscillation without where it's the isolation without.\n\nTwo years ago, I was, like, I was nowhere. So now it's it's I needed that to remind myself, like, listen. I came forward already. It's just not even been two years, to be honest. It's been fourteen months.\n\nBeautiful. Well, look, Barry. I appreciate you jumping on.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/3i9yz2it18?autoplay=0&wmode=transparent&wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

How is it going, man? It's been a long time since I brought you on. And, honestly, it's been quite a while since I last saw you. I last saw you at the at the mastermind, But, we will we will dive into all of this juicy stuff in a second. I guess, really, first things first, perhaps you can give an introduction of who you are, what it is you do, and what your current monthly reoccurring revenue is and all of that type of good stuff.\n\nCool. So, I used to I used to. I run an agency here called Buizon Studios. We basically have property developers brand market launch and sell into the market.\n\nThat's how it was when I originally started. Right? When when you met me, I had the agency. Yep.\n\nRight? And we sort of before we used to do everything, we used to serve every niche, do every market, do every different type of product. And as soon as we joined the program, the first thing we got sorted out was our offer, figured out what clients we wanted to to work with, and that completely changed the way we work because we're able to offer a much better product. Like I said, work with just property developers launching residential projects into the market.\n\nAnd what we also managed to do is increase profitability like crazy because we knew exactly how to solve the problem exactly, like, making sure that the the product we're selling to our clients was as as top as possible. And we saw the results of that tenfold over. Like, I just closed the deal yesterday of fifty k just just like that because just because, like, people just come to us now when we're like, in my market, especially from where I'm from in Musa, anyone who has a development on the island just comes straight to us. Like, we don't even do any marketing really to it anymore.\n\nWe just promote the products product the products we've done and the projects we've worked on. But now it's just like, it's stupid for someone else not to work with us because we have so much experience and so much results in that specific niche. So Beautiful. Besides, like, like, that that besides the acquisition strategies you shared with us in the access school and Charlie has gone through and all of that, it's just, like, just helped us really hone in into what we wanted to do best, giving the best product and, like, being able to scale that side of it.\n\nFantastic. So how much how much is the business doing at the moment monthly?\n\nNow we're doing around fifty k a month, but, like, profitability wise, tenfold to what we used to do before. Like, we used to hardly any profits in Israel, like, ten percent, fifteen percent. Now our markups, our profit margins are much or way, way higher, like, fifty to sixty percent per project, which is which is much better for us. But at the same time, while that's running and I sort of we're not really I hired the creative director for that. I hired the whole team and built out the whole thing with regards to running the agency side. I'm not that involved in it anymore. I just do sales calls and just the sales meetings.\n\nAnd then through the mastermind, that completely changed my life, man.\n\nYeah. We're we're gonna dive into all of that. So just so just to give everybody some context to our home, the first time that Sam and I had a conversation was all the way back in twenty twenty two. It was right at the end of twenty twenty two. If I remember correctly, at that point in time, you were more focused just purely on web design and web development. I don't even think you'd made the transition into lead generation as as of yet.\n\nWe never had done any lead generation, to be honest.\n\nYep.\n\nAnd so what I think the the thing that you were trying to accomplish at that point in time is how do you transition how to go about, as you said, you know, getting the right offer in place, picking out the right completely forgot about that, man.\n\nTo be honest, it's like, our business is so legion now. It's like I completely forgot what we've met. I wasn't even doing any lead gen. It was just web.\n\nSo, like, now our product is what we said is we guarantee our clients that they get at least fifty qualified buyer leads every single month. Like, that's we don't even sell websites anymore. Our website is just, like, part of what we're selling and part of our process. But our offer now is, like, we're gonna get you leads, but to get you these qualified leads, we're gonna build you up your brand.\n\nWe're gonna build your website. We're gonna build your marketing. We're gonna be your CRM.\n\nLike, I forgot about that completely, to be honest.\n\nIt's crazy. It's crazy.\n\nIt might be hard to remember this because, again, you you've been with us for a long time. You've really seen the the progression, not only of Imperium, but also of Charlie. Like, if I remember, again, you came in through, the YouTube channel. This was back when Charlie had, like, I don't know, four thousand subscribers, not a hundred thousand subscribers.\n\nBut, with all of this in mind, like, what was it about Charlie even at that point in time that that attracted you to to to booking a call?\n\nI think it was just what he was saying. Like, the content he was giving away, he and he like, everything that I was going through, he was sort of pinpointing out in in his YouTube videos, to be honest. He was giving so much advice on, like, how to generate leads, how to book more appointments, how to close more deals. And we didn't really have that much as an agency.\n\nSo just hearing how he what process he had and the systems he had, it didn't just sound believable. It just sounded like this is exactly what I need, and this is exactly what's missing in my business. So it was just like, we have the product down. We thought we did.\n\nWe didn't. We learned that once we joined the program, but it was more of, like, his knowledge and expertise and just, like, showing us exactly what he needed to be done really and truly.\n\nAnd had you done any had you done any courses before that point in time?\n\nNo. I almost bought Imangadji's course. I thought it didn't, to be honest.\n\nAnd I paid, like, six grand to a sales company to try help us solve, like, go international and solve our sales problem, but that's like, we had zero results from that. We did we just throw away our money? Because we had someone doing outreach through email. We got zero leads.\n\nBut it wasn't even their fault to do this because we didn't even have an offer. We were just like, we're a web design a to z. Yeah. Like, I started realizing why we're going to the course and over the past two years, like, most of the things weren't working was because of our fault alone.\n\nWe just didn't have the knowledge to actually know how to scale it from our end.\n\nI think that's one thing that Charlie does really well is he helps you to realize that it's not just a specific piece of copy. It's not just gonna be a subject line that gets you there. Like, it's really the whole thing. You have to have the whole thing in place.\n\nYou can fire off a thousand emails a day if you want, but it doesn't mean you're gonna get any appointments.\n\nMan for good.\n\nBut taking it back to that point, because you you've been involved, in the previous product.\n\nYou were involved when it was just Imperium, agency prior to to Easy Grow, and then, obviously, you saw the transition into Yeah.\n\nI think it was, like, a month what differences have you seen, like, as time has gone by in terms of the products?\n\nThe program. Nothing bad. Just constant. Like, every other month, there's something new being added. I I jumped in back because I'm not really in the program anymore. Like, we we got exactly what we needed out of it, came to the mastermind.\n\nAnd jumping back in for a for a month, I think, it was like, wow. This is like a completely new program with regards to, like, running YouTube ads, running Facebook ads, the the Facebook and Go high level setup.\n\nSo the great thing about it is what I've implemented into my business now is just, like, constantly improving the the product and the iterations of the product, which is which is huge.\n\nAnd I I think that's, like, again, one of the biggest things that you get from Charlie is that he I think the thing that really separates him is that he's all about the product, and he makes you realize it needs to be all about the product.\n\nAnd that's probably why you're you're literally dominating your entire market right now is because Well, I believe in the same way, to be honest.\n\nLike, we didn't do any marketing, and we were kind of successful. We're doing, like, thirty k months, forty k months without doing zero marketing. This is just solely based on our product and our process working. So, like, going into the program and seeing how dedicated he was to the product and constantly evolving it just made me apply it even more, like, double down on that from our end as well. Like, the lead gen can work. You can get as many leads as you want. You can make as many sales as you want, but really and truly, for me, if there's more product than than product first and then going into that afterwards, just help me, like, be where I am today really and truly, I I feel.\n\nYou you talked about profit profitability.\n\nRight? Why why do you feel like, the product kind of helped you to maybe figure out some of those cakes?\n\nAnd biggest thing was just sort of finding one niche because we used to do everything for everyone. One day, we're doing an ecommerce site. One day, we're doing a restaurant's website. Another day, we're doing a hotel's website.\n\nAnd it's like, some projects are gonna fail. Some projects are gonna be do well. But what we've sort of put together was we have we would realize, like, okay. What's our best client here? Like, where are we making the most money? Who are we seeing the most results with?\n\nAnd doing the first chapter through the through the course, through school was, like, too easy to grow. I allowed us sort of to figure that out. Like, what is our offer? Who are we trying to serve?\n\nSo, like, now we're just serving property developers mainly, and that just allowed us to, like, okay. It's just this, this, this, and this every single time. There's no, like, hiccups. There's no, like, nothing we didn't expect to happen.\n\nWe are the authority once the client comes to us, and they listen to us because we've done it a hundred times before.\n\nWhereas before, it's like, okay. We need to start from the beginning here. We need to come up with a whole new strategy. We need to understand your business. We need to it never really worked because every time it's some completely different strategy, a a completely bit different problem you're trying to solve. And it's like, how are you expected to to improve your product if you don't have, like, one problem you're solving?\n\nMhmm. That makes sense.\n\nThat's the biggest thing for us, I would say, when it came to profitability because now it's like the process is one, two, three, four, five. We know exactly how to do it. We know exactly what works and what doesn't work. We spent thousands on ads to figure out what ads work as well for that niche. Yep. So clients are much happier because the results are much better every single time.\n\nBecause they're predictable because you've done that. You've done it over and over again.\n\nExactly. And we know that the next product is gonna be even better than once more because we're Yeah. The problems already. So it's great.\n\nAnd and that's why it's so important to just do one thing, really to just do one thing. Okay. Alright. Cool. So so beyond that, you were also talking about the offer, etcetera. What what would you say were your your biggest takeaways from the program? I'm sure that it's kind of changed as time has gone by, but what are, like, the key things that you really think moved the needle for you massively to help you get to that fifty k?\n\nI think it was just understanding outreach and how it all works because we had sent out thousands of emails before. We had tried cold calling. We had tried approaching. Nothing ever worked.\n\nRight? We sent out emails to you to Damak, which is the biggest property developer in Dubai. Right? And this this CMO, the top marketing manager of the company replied back to one of our emails because we're like, this is our offer.\n\nThis is what we can do. Okay. We didn't lead into our sale because we weren't ready for it.\n\nMhmm. But, like, I'd never thought cold outreach would work with regards to emails, and we got replies from some of the biggest companies in the world, the biggest property developer in the world replying back to one of the emails we sent out.\n\nThat's a cold email.\n\nAnd was this using the the Loom strategy?\n\nNo. Without the loans. Okay.\n\nBecause we fed the loan for for high end luxury.\n\nIt might have been a bit too, like, not work as well. So this is like, this is our offer. This who this will have helped. We want some of, like, massive international design awards from our end, from a web design point of view. So our our emails and our offer was very strong with regards to, like we've worked with projects on the likes of Zaha Hadid Architects, which are some of the biggest architectural fab in the world. We've won international design awards for the work we've done.\n\nSo our offer was quite strong when it comes to, like, this is who we are, this is how we can help you, and we could guarantee you sort of. We had a look at your website, and we can guarantee an increase in your convert you.\n\nSo from what from what I'm understanding, you feel like the reason why this was effective this time around before you you kind of jumped on board was because you knew who you need to talk to, and you had an offer that spoke perfectly to that market.\n\nExactly. Because then that applies to ads. It applies to your code outreach. It applies to anything else.\n\nSo like that for me, that was the key. It's like, fuck. Now I understand how business works. Like, why would anyone say, I used to run ads before as an agency and say, listen.\n\nWork with us. We do web development. It's like, now I feel stupid looking at what I used to put out as an ad because, like, what the hell is gonna click on that anyway? I mean, it's not speaking.\n\nIt's not calling out to anyone. It's not speaking to anyone.\n\nIt's a shotgun approach, and you're just hoping that something is gonna stick.\n\nI know it's gonna stick to that, so that was that was the biggest thing for us.\n\nOkay. Cool. Let's let's talk about the mastermind then. So, I think, actually, Charlie posted a video from the mastermind on the YouTube channel, like, a couple of days ago. We decided to come over for the mastermind. Why why was that?\n\nBecause the program really, I don't know, changed my life with regards to the program because it was solving my biggest problems I had. It was like, how am I ever gonna get more leads? And the results we got out of it sort of had so much of an impact in my business life and my life as well. It's like, okay, man.\n\nI want to learn more about how I can scale this faster, how I can scale this differently. And to be honest, I come from a place where there's not much happening here, like, with my friends and sort of in my country with regards to agencies and sort of scaling. So being around Charlie and the team and learning from you guys was something that was exciting for me. So I said, let's do it.\n\nI mean, I I made them I made that six k back within the first month of joining of joining the program. Right? So I was like, listen. If I if I double my money within the first month of joining, what's gonna happen if I have, like, one on one of him looking at into our business and then sort of Charlie giving us advice and guiding us to it also?\n\nI jumped on the idea straight away.\n\nAnd what would you say were some of your key takeaways from the the mastermind? Because I know by the sounds of things for you, you've decided to stay with the agency model.\n\nI know a part of the mastermind was more focused on showing people how to That's that's that's the big thing.\n\nSo Okay. The agency is running itself now. And now my whole model for myself is I just do sales for the agency with regards to property developers. And now I have around, I did thirty thirty five k in sales in just program and course training with regards to I train real estate agents.\n\nBasically, easy grow Mhmm.\n\nBut for real estate agents.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo we have have we got two separate revenue streams here, or is this is this combined fifty k? So we got the fifty k we got the fifty k on the agency, and then we've got the thirty five coming in from the course as well.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And that's it. That's growing in the month. That's, like, I'm just dialing in my my ad, so it's good.\n\nGood job, Sam. Okay. Let's let's let's explore this in more detail then.\n\nBecause, obviously, I I think a lot of you didn't really know what to expect when when we No.\n\nNo idea. Into the mastermind.\n\nExactly. It was a bit of a thing on the first day where Charlie was like, guys, all of you are experienced. All of you know what you're doing. You've got expertise.\n\nI really think it makes sense for you to start transitioning over to input product. And I I I'm sure at that point in time, it must have been like, I don't know. Does this does this really make sense?\n\nSince doing that, Sam, what are what are your thoughts? Like, do you find operationally, it's a lot simpler, you have a better quality of life?\n\nLike, what does what does that look like for you?\n\nSo before I came to the mastermind, I was really thinking about I I already had set up a bit of it with regards to, like, how it all work because I was inspired by Easygram. Like, love. This makes so much more sense. Like, rather than doing the actual work, like, agency life, training people to do themselves.\n\nSo I came there with that at the back of my head already. I already had, like, drawn out the business plan of how it all works. So when I came there, he said that. Charlie said, like, listen.\n\nWe're gonna focus on building out your own program. I'm like, this couldn't be better for me. So I went into there and came out of that. Like, it changed my life tenfold over, man.\n\nLike, to be honest, I think it is just meeting you guys and understanding how the team works and how we all inspired you are with regards to Charlie and the vision and yourself. So to me, just that alone was, like, completely changed the way I work with my team, the way I work with like, it's it's called agent leaders, the agent leaders dot com, my program. And, like, I implemented everything he said with regards to, like, building out a team, like, building out a vision. I never had that with my other comp with Bison, with the agency.\n\nBut with the agent leaders now, it's like, I know I want to go. Understanding how to build out a team that's motivated and sort of all believe in the same vision was huge to me because in an agency, we never really had that.\n\nAnd it's like now it's much more rewarding. Besides, it's much more profitable. Besides, it's a much better quality of life because you're not really implementing the things yourself.\n\nIt's so much more rewarding because I have people saying you're changing my life, man. It's like, for me, that is the biggest thing. It's like, okay. I built a new business. We're making thirty five, forty k months.\n\nBut really and truly, it's like like, the satisfaction I get from my team members seeing me as a leader now based on, like, understanding the vision, where I want to go and stuff. Being, like helping them set their goals, helping them figure out what they want to do with their lives and implementing the same things with the clients who sign up for the program is, like, seeing the feedback I get from there is, like, we're I'm I'm teaching them skills like Charlie taught us that are gonna last last a lifetime for them and, like, their understanding of their problems with with their business. So it's been like a full circle moment. It's like, okay. I started with Easy Grow. It changed my life, went to the mastermind. Now I'm doing the same thing with with my client in this stage.\n\nIt's it's kind of crazy to think about because it actually hasn't been that long. Like, it's been, what, around fourteen months. Yes. Yeah. About fourteen, fifteen months. It's really not you've gone from web design to to lead gen to consulting. And do you do you put that down to the fact that, I guess, perhaps you've had, like, a clear road map in in place to be able to follow, that you've been able to move up that speed because of that.\n\nHundred percent. Hundred percent. I would I would say, like, having like, if I didn't join the program, I would not have started this info business. I would have not have solved my problems.\n\nSo it's like even just joining the program and understanding how the easy go program was set up with go high level. I didn't even know what go high level was two years ago before I joined the program. Mhmm. So it's like, without having that, it's like is crazy.\n\nKnow. I'd be stuck in doing the same thing I've been doing for the part for the.\n\nIt's been life changing, honestly, man. Even the people I met at the mastermind. I joined Brian Moncada's mastermind as well.\n\nYeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. I I really enjoyed that as well, but it was it's this is the other thing, I think, that is so understated about being part of a community.\n\nIt's the people. It's the networking. It's the access to information that you get. It's insane.\n\nIt's insane. Okay. Well, look. Let's let's kind of future pace a little bit. Let's look to the future.\n\nYeah. What what is the goal then? Because you're running two businesses at the moment. One of them is doing fifty k.\n\nThe other is doing thirty five k. Is is the plan just to just let the agency side of things tick over, maybe prepare for an exit, and scale up the coaching business?\n\nWhat's what's the focus solely on the coaching business, really and truly, because the agency, we're just working with clients that like, we have a set process. We have a creative director there. I'm just doing sales organically that comes to us. We're not even doing any marketing or any outreach anymore.\n\nSo I'm just letting that whoever comes in and and, like, jobs around fifty k jobs for us. So for it's it's silly for us to say no. Clients are happy. We're still building up whatever we have there for the past years of work.\n\nI mean, it's so that's just running itself. So I'm not gonna I'm not focusing too much on the agency. I have a partner in the agency, but on on agent leaders, that's me completely alone.\n\nSo Do do you know what?\n\nIt's so funny that you mentioned this because I was looking back at my notes from the call.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd on the notes, it said, he wants to get started, but he needs to speak to his business partner about this, took a hundred dollar deposit. So I'm guessing it it might be that that was the business partner.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou're talking about. And it's it's scary to think. And this like, I try so hard on the sales calls for this reason. Like, it's terrifying to think if you hadn't done this, what would have happened? Like, what life would look like if you didn't come on board?\n\nI guess, on that note then, Sam, what what is the best piece of advice that you could give to somebody who's maybe, you know, jumping on a call with me, jumping on a call with one of the other reps? And they're like, I don't know. Like, I don't know if this is gonna be the right thing for me. Is is this worth me making this investment? Should I take this step? Should I take this risk? What would you say to them?\n\nI would say just if your problem is being organized lead generation, you have no stop vision of where you want to go, what you need guidance, then there's this the proof is there. Like, there's everything you need to have in the course itself. You have Charlie who's, like, doing, I don't know, millions a month with regards to revenue in the info product and in the sort of agency space as well he used to before. So it's like, if you're gonna learn from someone, there's no one else on the market, I think, that you can learn from. It's like, what I realized was instead of spending five, six years maybe finding the information I needed to find, I found it within a week of joining the program.\n\nSo, like And I think that's so powerful given how much you have done in such short period of time.\n\nBecause this is what I say to people all the time is I don't doubt that you could make it happen. Like, you can, but it just might take you three, four, five years to get there. But for you to have basically gone through three different businesses and scaled them so quickly, it's because you just have that access to the information.\n\nIt's right there to make there.\n\nLike, if you wanted, it's there. Like, you you can pay five hundred grand for something. But, I mean, if you're not gonna do the work, it's gonna be you're not gonna get anywhere. So if you're ready to do the work and if you're ready to put in and you're ready to sort of grow, then there's nowhere else you need to be.\n\nLiterally, you have every single tool you need to actually grow right in front of you. You can go to the program, and I don't know how many weeks we're gonna take you. I I have just took the pieces of information that I thought apply to my agency. Within two weeks, I was implementing everything and and changing what needed to be changed.\n\nSo it's like, rather than spending two, three years, four years, what that's what I told my business partner. I'm like, listen. If we never paid for this course, we'd be in this exact same position, hoping, like, let's run another stupid ad, and let's do another email without understanding how it's gonna work. Like, you just have information that works.\n\nSo for me, it's like, the way I think now is so different because as soon as I have a problem, I just look for someone who's solved that problem before. Yep. And Charlie has solved every single one of those problems in the COVID. So it's like, why wouldn't you pay for it?\n\nIt's it's like Okay.\n\nCool. Well, look. I guess to wrap this up, is there is there anything else that you wanna bring to the table?\n\nIs there anything else that you wanna share with people just before we before we No, man.\n\nTo be honest, I needed that too because I was feeling today was like one of those sales calls today where it's so different, like, selling the program than selling the agency work because the agency work are people are coming to us most of the time. Mhmm. They want to work with us. And now with these, I'm running guides out.\n\nSo it's been one of those days where, like, one call didn't show up. Two people Yeah. I understand. Yeah. I understand. But now what am I doing?\n\nNow I'm just realizing It's the oscillation without where it's the isolation without.\n\nTwo years ago, I was, like, I was nowhere. So now it's it's I needed that to remind myself, like, listen. I came forward already. It's just not even been two years, to be honest. It's been fourteen months.\n\nBeautiful. Well, look, Barry. I appreciate you jumping on."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}}, {});
