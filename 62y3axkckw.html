How's it going? It's Charlie Morgan here, and welcome back to another client interview, with a very happy client of ours. I love doing these things, and I'm really happy.\n\nMichael scaled his agency stroke coaching business from thirteen thousand a month to twenty five thousand a month in five months of working with us. So basically, in five months, we've been working with him and basically helping him build client acquisition systems for appointment booking in sales. So he now routinely books, like, like, one to two appointments a day. It's not huge numbers, but he's very happy with the outcome, and he's gone from six figures to multi six figures with us.\n\nI wanted to interview him, and, basically, he's gonna explain how he's done it and also some secrets in the program that have allowed him to help facilitate that transformation. So you watch the whole video, towards the end, it'll become very clear to you how he's been able to do this, and I'm looking forward to having you watch it. So if you enjoy this video, see the next one. Alright, everyone.\n\nHow's it going? It's Charlie Morgan, and welcome to yet another client interview. Today, I'm joined by Michael, a client and a close friend of mine, that I've known now for about five months. And, yes, we do indeed have the same artwork in our offices.\n\nSo Mhmm. Both do like what's it what's it called? What's that artwork called?\n\nWell, it's, obviously oh, that's Creation of Adam?\n\nCreation of Adam.\n\nExactly. There we go. So I just threw you straight into a bit of chaos there.\n\nI was, like, embarrassed.\n\nYeah. But long story short, Michael's been working with Imperium, using our program for about five months. In that time, he's effectively doubled his monthly revenue for his coaching business, Stroke Agency, which we'll talk about, adding around thirteen thousand dollars using, predominantly, if I'm not mistaken, our loom system.\n\nSo, Michael, why don't you take a second just to introduce yourself, explain who you are, and then we'll talk a little bit about where you were before the program. Absolutely.\n\nYeah. So my name is Michael Baranis. I run a coaching business together with my wife, Anna.\n\nIt's a coaching business, and we've also added agency elements to it. And we've been doing this for the last four, four and a half years. She joined only about, like, a year ago or so. Until then, I was running it alone.\n\nAnd we help consultants win clients. So it's very much focused on the consulting world. We do have a couple of coaches working with us as well. The, you know, the the limits are quite porous between these concepts.\n\nAnd, yeah. So it's, it's it's it's been going well.\n\nAnd we met, as you said, Will, we actually met already one and a half years years ago where you send me the first Loom video, which was Oh, I forgot about that.\n\nAlways yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt it it kept being on my mind. It's like, jeez. I wanna figure out how he does that because it was really well done. And so then I was, gradually more and more listening to you on YouTube, And then I realized at some point, I realized, yeah, I'm gonna have to work with this guy. He's just too good. And, because I do sign up with one coach every year, so I was like, okay. Charlie's gonna be my twenty twenty two guy.\n\nNo? Love it. Well, hopefully, we can be a twenty twenty three guys as well. But, no.\n\nIt's Who knows?\n\nSo when when you what problems were you facing that led to you actually purchasing the program? Because, obviously, you were doing relatively well, making six figures, helping coaches and consultants.\n\nWhat were the issues you were facing that you wanted to get solved?\n\nIt's a really interesting question because I I felt like I was doing well with conversational prospecting and basically booking calls, but I simply wasn't having enough calls.\n\nAnd one of the reasons was that one of the ways, and this is also what we teach our, what we teach our clients, is we do conversational prospecting on LinkedIn, and that was kind of one of the main ways of of booking calls. And it works really well. The one problem with it is that it requires a lot of cognitive energy. Mhmm.\n\nYou need to be sort of on your game all the time when you are doing conversation prospecting. It's basically like chatting up people in, at an event. Right? And that always takes energy.\n\nRight? Especially if you're slightly on the introverted side, it just takes a lot of energy.\n\nAnd what I found really intriguing about your method, about the cold email methods first of all, when I received your cold email, I didn't feel in any way bothered, and that is because it was good. And that I mean, this is part of what we sell to our clients is Yeah. No sales approach is is, you don't have to be embarrassed by a sales approach if your pitch is good. So just make sure you do a good pitch, and then you don't have to worry about bothering people interrupting them. Just do it well. And yours was done really well. And the thing that was really what I thought I need help with that is creating a system where I can book calls without thinking.\n\nMhmm.\n\nAnd that was the issue that I had on conversational prospecting is that it requires your cognitive effort. The the email, you just do the cognitive effort once where you craft the email and when you create the Loom script and all of that. But then it's pure mechanics. You just can do it, and you just roll it out, and then you gradually hand it over to a VA, and it just works like a charm.\n\nAnd, it's it's, that was the one main thing. So long answer to your short question, what was my problem? I was not booking enough calls. Be also because I was subconsciously avoiding the cognitive effort of doing conversational prospecting myself.\n\nYeah.\n\nI've always looked at conversations because I know that cold messaging is pretty one of the one of the you know, you receive messages from people and they're like, oh, like, how's your business going? And, like, from my perspective, like, I've tried to I've tried it before. And when I try and reach out to people that are making a significant amount of money, they don't even wanna entertain it, if that makes sense, because it's like they're just too busy. They just wanna know what you do.\n\nAnd I've and I've noticed now that if someone start reach reaches out to me on social media trying to start a conversation, I just don't even bother. Because it's like, if you wanna sell me something, just sell it to me. And if I like it, I'll make a decision. But dancing around it is quite hard.\n\nAnd, also, conversations, like you said, they just don't scale, so I completely empathize with that. Yep. So you you hopped into the program, sort of April, end of April this year twenty twenty, and you wanted specifically to systemize client acquisition. So, obviously, you've done that quite well because you've added an extra sort of six figures, to the bottom line.\n\nSpecifically to do with the program, for anyone watching that's curious, what do you feel we did right that was able to help you get to that point and have that extra thirteen k in revenue?\n\nWell, what you did right is that the tactics are very well thought through. The com the content is very comprehensive. So there's never an issue with, oh, I don't know how to do this. You don't skirt over topics. Right? You just go into in excruciating detail into everything.\n\nIt is very excruciating to make as well. By the way.\n\nYeah. I can imagine. Yeah. Yeah. And so that I think is excellent. I think also you run the calls in a very efficient way.\n\nThat is good. So those are those are couple of really good points that I've taken away. And, you know, I I don't know to what degree I'm representative of your other clients. I think I I am.\n\nBut what I just don't need a huge amount of hand holding, I feel. Yeah. It's just that give me the tools, give me the tactics, and I'll implement it myself. That's why I've also recently, I haven't been much on calls because I'm sort of getting it now.\n\nThings are rolling. And I it's probably best for you, you know, from a from, you know, operational point of view. Right? I got my value.\n\nIt's great, and I'm barely showing up for calls anymore. Yeah. And so I think you do this really well that you, get give people everything they need to implement the stuff themselves.\n\nMhmm.\n\nAnd then you are there for when, you know, you need people need a bit of help. But Yeah.\n\nThat combination of the comprehensiveness and then running the calls in a very efficient way Yeah.\n\nThat's pretty good. We we designed the program to be a like, we wanted the content to be a vacuum for support, if that makes sense. So, obviously, people are gonna have questions, but, like, I can pretty confidently say that seventy five percent of all questions we get asked on coaching calls are at some point covered in the content. The issue is, obviously, there's a lot of bloody content for that reason, so it kinda cancels itself out, which is what we've learned.\n\nYeah. But I'm I'm glad you think that. So you've you've built the Loom system. Am I correct in thinking that's the the main one you've used, or do you have any other acquisition systems that you've used from us?\n\nIt's just a cold email? No. It's mainly that. Yeah.\n\nAnd how many appointments are you booking per week with that?\n\nLike, one or two a day or something?\n\nYep. Something like that.\n\nYeah.\n\nI could do more, but, frankly, I have now so many clients also done for you clients, which is one dilemma that I'm currently, struggling with as you know.\n\nBut I have I have I have so many clients now that I frankly would be hard to handle more, and so I just want to integrate everything that is going on, before ramping up. And you told me that I should start doing ads, which is another thing I need to get get over some mindset issues there.\n\nYeah. So the the problem that you're facing right now then is the systems work so well that you're at the point where you're too busy with work to start acquiring new clients so that the next step becomes operational capacity, I suppose.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat's bloody brilliant. So what's what is next for the business? Because, obviously, you're you're in the position now where you've got a multi six figure, coaching company. Right? And you've got a sort of mix of couple of different services, but, ultimately, you've got a way of acquiring clients. And now you've got this obstacle of too much. So what what's next for the company, and and where do you see Imperium potentially fitting into that?\n\nWell, let's cover the first question first.\n\nWhat's next for the company? That is I keep thinking about one thing that you told me and what also I hear from Alex or Mosey is that you can get to a million run rate with just one product, one channel even.\n\nOr I'm a little bit skeptical whether it would really be one channel, but I do hundred percent believe that I could get to a million dollar run rate with the coaching program, just purely selling that. And my current sort of slight challenge that I have is that I still have agency clients as well, done for you work. And so I believe that over the next six months, that will something will have to give. Right?\n\nEither I go full time on agency or full time on coaching. I don't have that clearly decided yet, but there I will have to make a painful decision. Right now, the reason why I'm not making the decision is because I simply don't feel like turning revenue away. Because I was I have been for for a long time, I was at this ten, fifteen k a month level.\n\nAnd now that it's firmly in the twenty plus territory, I just don't want to risk going back to the old territory again. So something I need to overcome. But I very much believe, and I'm giving myself that goal that within, like, that's that's three months from now. Come the new year, I will not take on any new, agency clients and then gradually phase out existing agency clients, of course, while keeping them happy and all of that.\n\nThat is currently the plan.\n\nIt's it's evolving. So It's a good plan.\n\nThink it also allows you to build cash reserves.\n\nYeah. Because, like, we've we've got clients who, who are in a similar situation to you, different niches. And they're doing like, they start doing coaching, and they're like, oh, this coaching thing is, like, much preferable to done for you. Should I just drop all my agency clients and then just, like, start doing coaching full time?\n\nAnd it's like, no. Because it has to be a transition. Otherwise, you end up going back to, like you lose just, like, ten k revenue like that. And at the end of the day, like, that's profit.\n\nYou know? So you don't wanna cut it out. So that makes sense. So your your goal, if I'm not mistaken, is, like, eighty grand, a hundred grand a month?\n\nMonth. Oh, hundred percent. Yeah. It's like for me, I I I don't even consider half a million a year a worthy milestone.\n\nYeah. And this has been also something I really appreciated your the mindset training in the in the program. It's truly excellent, because you want to get to a point where your current level of revenue is just something like, obviously, I'm making that. Like, for me, I just wanna be able to say, well, dude, twenty five is, like, the bare minimum.\n\nRight? It's like it's as you say, it should be disgusting to you to make twenty five k. Right? Yeah.\n\nSo for me, I wanna get to that point where hundred k a month is the new normal. Yeah. And that is that's the goal. Like, I I don't consider the five hundred or, like, forty k a month.\n\nThat's just a bit of a gradual change for me, and that will get me to, obviously, half a million. Yeah. That is just not enough anymore. Right?\n\nIt's just the million a year is, like, the next hygiene standards. And I just I just know that I can do it.\n\nCouple of obstacles in the way, but I'll get there.\n\nI think just just for everyone watching as well, as as you reference the mindset training, one of the the core mindset strategy we have in the program is, there's a fancy term for it. I won't go into too much detail. But, basically, what you celebrate is what you limit yourself at. So if you think that, like, ten k a month is, the be all and end all and the holy grail of income, that's all you're ever gonna make.\n\nBut if you see ten k a month as the worst possible thing that could ever happen to you, and what I mean by that is, like, you'd never dip below that amount. It would be like, you know, not flushing your toilet for three weeks. Like, it's a hygiene standard. Right?\n\nYou do it because it happens and, like, no matter what that it would be disgusting to not do that. It's a very good strategy because I and then we see that manifest like it has in you, for example, Michael, where you don't wanna just go from twenty five to fifty because you just see fifty. It's just like, it's just fifty, you know, and then you can you can move on. And that creates a lot of pain as well, and it's a really good thing to have.\n\nYep.\n\nThat's awesome, man.\n\nSo there's a couple a couple things. Now it's now it's time to see if I can get you to potentially sell my program for me.\n\nIf you were because I know you obviously you you had your hesitations about working with us and stuff, and it took you a while to come around to it. If you were thinking about booking a call or buying the program we've got, what advice would you give to that person knowing what you know now about the program?\n\nSo you have nothing to risk. Right? That's the great thing. This was ultimately the thing that got me over the line is that you offer this money back guarantee, which I've completely taken over.\n\nIt's I've I'm doing that myself now as well. And it's truly down to you to the question is whether you trust yourself enough that you will actually do the work. That is the only thing. Because when when you do the work, you will get results.\n\nThere's zero doubt about that. Like, it I you guys say that you had one refund, and that was only because you didn't have it in the terms and conditions at the time that people need to do the work. Right? So you don't do refunds.\n\nYou don't need to do them because, obviously, your system works. And so that is to me the single most clear no brainer that listen.\n\nIf you're not booking at least one to two sales calls a day I love the dramatic throat.\n\nYeah. No. No. I just wanted to so that you can edit this out.\n\nNo. It's a little bit it's it's fine. Doesn't matter. Keep it clean.\n\nIf you're not booking one to two sales calls a day, then do something so those do something so that you book those one to two sales calls a day. Yeah. And Charlie's program is just excellent because it provides excruciating level of detail, a truly outstanding world class mindset module, and you will get your results. And if you don't, you get your money back, you know, which is, again, extremely unlikely.\n\nSo there's zero reason. Like, if you think if and, also, that's the thing. I really like you as a guy. Right?\n\nAnd so But when you when you make someone an extra hundred grand a year, that does tend to, naturally manifest.\n\nNo. But I also liked you, and that's the thing. We met. We had a sales call back in March or April twenty twenty one.\n\nRight? And there, I was neutral towards you. You tried to sell me something. I said no because I was just mistaken about the type of the service, and then we just kind of lost touch.\n\nAnd then you started doing YouTube videos more frequently, and I started watching them. And I thought, jeez. This guy is really good in what he says. He's better than most other these type of gurus.\n\nAnd so I developed a strong affinity for you, and then it was just purely okay. It's just I will need to do it, obviously. Yeah. And it's just then the moment of when and and when it's the right time.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo, that was those were my my considerations. So there has to be a a level a degree of of of appreciation for the person. You need to like them.\n\nMhmm.\n\nRight? And so for that, I think the YouTube videos that you do are excellent because you really develop an affinity for for somebody personally.\n\nSo YouTube is, like, just a weapon.\n\nYeah. It is. Take when you take familiarity and risk reversal and combine them, like, it it's just, like, it just builds, like I've I always look at client acquisition and, like, everything we do, like, how can we build the most trust?\n\nAnd it's like, well, where do you get trust from? Well, you get it from you there's three things. Like, do you trust just do you trust yourself to do the work? Most people do.\n\nSo that's always taken out. And then it's like, well, do you trust the person running the program? Me, I for example. And then do you trust the program?\n\nAnd, like, if you wanna trust me, you just have to become familiar enough with me. That's how the brain works. But to trust the program, you have to recognize there's a guarantee in place. So when we marry a lot of familiarity with a guarantee, there's just so much trust that, like, people just how would you say no to someone that you like and that will give you back?\n\nBecause the other thing is that if you trust me, then you trust me to be honest with my guarantee. Yep. Because it's like, if you if you know that you trust me and that I'm telling the truth, then that's natural. Then when I tell you, I'll give you back your money.\n\nYou actually believe it. Whereas I see a lot of people these days offering guarantees and, like, I'll scale your agents to get ten k a month in the next three months, and if I don't, I'll give you all your money back. And you don't believe them. It's like, well, what's what's holding you accountable to that promise?\n\nIt's like you don't have a reputation or an audience to uphold, so there's nothing really sitting under that. So I think a lot of people think that, like, guarantees and offers create trust, and they do, but not as much as if you have familiarity with the person.\n\nBut Mhmm.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWell, I think we'll we'll close there.\n\nJust keep it short and sweet. I really do appreciate you taking the time, mate, and coming on board.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nHow can people find you?\n\nBecause I know you've got a YouTube channel as well. I could link that in the description if you like.\n\nYeah. Absolutely. So, the website is michael barnes dot com, Michael without an e. And we are you can find me on LinkedIn and, get in touch in that way.\n\nBeautiful, mate. Well, no doubt we'll be talking again in twelve months or so when you get to a hundred grand a month.\n\nI'll look for it.\n\nOh, yeah. What? Twelve months?\n\nOh, I'm gonna get there faster.\n\nYeah. Well, you haven't you haven't entered the realm of sales reps yet, my friend. Oh, yeah. Yeah.\n\nThat's where it's that's where you can Is that necessary?\n\nNo. For a hundred k a month, is that necessary?\n\nIt depends what sort of life you want.\n\nYeah. Yeah. You can can get no.\n\nYou can do a hundred k a month if you're just the one doing the calls. You can do a hundred fifty k a month if you're just the one doing the calls, but then all you do is calls. So it's like you don't feel like a business owner, but but either way. And it doesn't sustain itself because eventually you have to work on other things.\n\nBut we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. But, pleasure, man. I'll talk to you later. Thanks for watching, everyone.\n\nPeace.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/62y3axkckw?autoplay=0&wmode=transparent&wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

How's it going? It's Charlie Morgan here, and welcome back to another client interview, with a very happy client of ours. I love doing these things, and I'm really happy.\n\nMichael scaled his agency stroke coaching business from thirteen thousand a month to twenty five thousand a month in five months of working with us. So basically, in five months, we've been working with him and basically helping him build client acquisition systems for appointment booking in sales. So he now routinely books, like, like, one to two appointments a day. It's not huge numbers, but he's very happy with the outcome, and he's gone from six figures to multi six figures with us.\n\nI wanted to interview him, and, basically, he's gonna explain how he's done it and also some secrets in the program that have allowed him to help facilitate that transformation. So you watch the whole video, towards the end, it'll become very clear to you how he's been able to do this, and I'm looking forward to having you watch it. So if you enjoy this video, see the next one. Alright, everyone.\n\nHow's it going? It's Charlie Morgan, and welcome to yet another client interview. Today, I'm joined by Michael, a client and a close friend of mine, that I've known now for about five months. And, yes, we do indeed have the same artwork in our offices.\n\nSo Mhmm. Both do like what's it what's it called? What's that artwork called?\n\nWell, it's, obviously oh, that's Creation of Adam?\n\nCreation of Adam.\n\nExactly. There we go. So I just threw you straight into a bit of chaos there.\n\nI was, like, embarrassed.\n\nYeah. But long story short, Michael's been working with Imperium, using our program for about five months. In that time, he's effectively doubled his monthly revenue for his coaching business, Stroke Agency, which we'll talk about, adding around thirteen thousand dollars using, predominantly, if I'm not mistaken, our loom system.\n\nSo, Michael, why don't you take a second just to introduce yourself, explain who you are, and then we'll talk a little bit about where you were before the program. Absolutely.\n\nYeah. So my name is Michael Baranis. I run a coaching business together with my wife, Anna.\n\nIt's a coaching business, and we've also added agency elements to it. And we've been doing this for the last four, four and a half years. She joined only about, like, a year ago or so. Until then, I was running it alone.\n\nAnd we help consultants win clients. So it's very much focused on the consulting world. We do have a couple of coaches working with us as well. The, you know, the the limits are quite porous between these concepts.\n\nAnd, yeah. So it's, it's it's it's been going well.\n\nAnd we met, as you said, Will, we actually met already one and a half years years ago where you send me the first Loom video, which was Oh, I forgot about that.\n\nAlways yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt it it kept being on my mind. It's like, jeez. I wanna figure out how he does that because it was really well done. And so then I was, gradually more and more listening to you on YouTube, And then I realized at some point, I realized, yeah, I'm gonna have to work with this guy. He's just too good. And, because I do sign up with one coach every year, so I was like, okay. Charlie's gonna be my twenty twenty two guy.\n\nNo? Love it. Well, hopefully, we can be a twenty twenty three guys as well. But, no.\n\nIt's Who knows?\n\nSo when when you what problems were you facing that led to you actually purchasing the program? Because, obviously, you were doing relatively well, making six figures, helping coaches and consultants.\n\nWhat were the issues you were facing that you wanted to get solved?\n\nIt's a really interesting question because I I felt like I was doing well with conversational prospecting and basically booking calls, but I simply wasn't having enough calls.\n\nAnd one of the reasons was that one of the ways, and this is also what we teach our, what we teach our clients, is we do conversational prospecting on LinkedIn, and that was kind of one of the main ways of of booking calls. And it works really well. The one problem with it is that it requires a lot of cognitive energy. Mhmm.\n\nYou need to be sort of on your game all the time when you are doing conversation prospecting. It's basically like chatting up people in, at an event. Right? And that always takes energy.\n\nRight? Especially if you're slightly on the introverted side, it just takes a lot of energy.\n\nAnd what I found really intriguing about your method, about the cold email methods first of all, when I received your cold email, I didn't feel in any way bothered, and that is because it was good. And that I mean, this is part of what we sell to our clients is Yeah. No sales approach is is, you don't have to be embarrassed by a sales approach if your pitch is good. So just make sure you do a good pitch, and then you don't have to worry about bothering people interrupting them. Just do it well. And yours was done really well. And the thing that was really what I thought I need help with that is creating a system where I can book calls without thinking.\n\nMhmm.\n\nAnd that was the issue that I had on conversational prospecting is that it requires your cognitive effort. The the email, you just do the cognitive effort once where you craft the email and when you create the Loom script and all of that. But then it's pure mechanics. You just can do it, and you just roll it out, and then you gradually hand it over to a VA, and it just works like a charm.\n\nAnd, it's it's, that was the one main thing. So long answer to your short question, what was my problem? I was not booking enough calls. Be also because I was subconsciously avoiding the cognitive effort of doing conversational prospecting myself.\n\nYeah.\n\nI've always looked at conversations because I know that cold messaging is pretty one of the one of the you know, you receive messages from people and they're like, oh, like, how's your business going? And, like, from my perspective, like, I've tried to I've tried it before. And when I try and reach out to people that are making a significant amount of money, they don't even wanna entertain it, if that makes sense, because it's like they're just too busy. They just wanna know what you do.\n\nAnd I've and I've noticed now that if someone start reach reaches out to me on social media trying to start a conversation, I just don't even bother. Because it's like, if you wanna sell me something, just sell it to me. And if I like it, I'll make a decision. But dancing around it is quite hard.\n\nAnd, also, conversations, like you said, they just don't scale, so I completely empathize with that. Yep. So you you hopped into the program, sort of April, end of April this year twenty twenty, and you wanted specifically to systemize client acquisition. So, obviously, you've done that quite well because you've added an extra sort of six figures, to the bottom line.\n\nSpecifically to do with the program, for anyone watching that's curious, what do you feel we did right that was able to help you get to that point and have that extra thirteen k in revenue?\n\nWell, what you did right is that the tactics are very well thought through. The com the content is very comprehensive. So there's never an issue with, oh, I don't know how to do this. You don't skirt over topics. Right? You just go into in excruciating detail into everything.\n\nIt is very excruciating to make as well. By the way.\n\nYeah. I can imagine. Yeah. Yeah. And so that I think is excellent. I think also you run the calls in a very efficient way.\n\nThat is good. So those are those are couple of really good points that I've taken away. And, you know, I I don't know to what degree I'm representative of your other clients. I think I I am.\n\nBut what I just don't need a huge amount of hand holding, I feel. Yeah. It's just that give me the tools, give me the tactics, and I'll implement it myself. That's why I've also recently, I haven't been much on calls because I'm sort of getting it now.\n\nThings are rolling. And I it's probably best for you, you know, from a from, you know, operational point of view. Right? I got my value.\n\nIt's great, and I'm barely showing up for calls anymore. Yeah. And so I think you do this really well that you, get give people everything they need to implement the stuff themselves.\n\nMhmm.\n\nAnd then you are there for when, you know, you need people need a bit of help. But Yeah.\n\nThat combination of the comprehensiveness and then running the calls in a very efficient way Yeah.\n\nThat's pretty good. We we designed the program to be a like, we wanted the content to be a vacuum for support, if that makes sense. So, obviously, people are gonna have questions, but, like, I can pretty confidently say that seventy five percent of all questions we get asked on coaching calls are at some point covered in the content. The issue is, obviously, there's a lot of bloody content for that reason, so it kinda cancels itself out, which is what we've learned.\n\nYeah. But I'm I'm glad you think that. So you've you've built the Loom system. Am I correct in thinking that's the the main one you've used, or do you have any other acquisition systems that you've used from us?\n\nIt's just a cold email? No. It's mainly that. Yeah.\n\nAnd how many appointments are you booking per week with that?\n\nLike, one or two a day or something?\n\nYep. Something like that.\n\nYeah.\n\nI could do more, but, frankly, I have now so many clients also done for you clients, which is one dilemma that I'm currently, struggling with as you know.\n\nBut I have I have I have so many clients now that I frankly would be hard to handle more, and so I just want to integrate everything that is going on, before ramping up. And you told me that I should start doing ads, which is another thing I need to get get over some mindset issues there.\n\nYeah. So the the problem that you're facing right now then is the systems work so well that you're at the point where you're too busy with work to start acquiring new clients so that the next step becomes operational capacity, I suppose.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat's bloody brilliant. So what's what is next for the business? Because, obviously, you're you're in the position now where you've got a multi six figure, coaching company. Right? And you've got a sort of mix of couple of different services, but, ultimately, you've got a way of acquiring clients. And now you've got this obstacle of too much. So what what's next for the company, and and where do you see Imperium potentially fitting into that?\n\nWell, let's cover the first question first.\n\nWhat's next for the company? That is I keep thinking about one thing that you told me and what also I hear from Alex or Mosey is that you can get to a million run rate with just one product, one channel even.\n\nOr I'm a little bit skeptical whether it would really be one channel, but I do hundred percent believe that I could get to a million dollar run rate with the coaching program, just purely selling that. And my current sort of slight challenge that I have is that I still have agency clients as well, done for you work. And so I believe that over the next six months, that will something will have to give. Right?\n\nEither I go full time on agency or full time on coaching. I don't have that clearly decided yet, but there I will have to make a painful decision. Right now, the reason why I'm not making the decision is because I simply don't feel like turning revenue away. Because I was I have been for for a long time, I was at this ten, fifteen k a month level.\n\nAnd now that it's firmly in the twenty plus territory, I just don't want to risk going back to the old territory again. So something I need to overcome. But I very much believe, and I'm giving myself that goal that within, like, that's that's three months from now. Come the new year, I will not take on any new, agency clients and then gradually phase out existing agency clients, of course, while keeping them happy and all of that.\n\nThat is currently the plan.\n\nIt's it's evolving. So It's a good plan.\n\nThink it also allows you to build cash reserves.\n\nYeah. Because, like, we've we've got clients who, who are in a similar situation to you, different niches. And they're doing like, they start doing coaching, and they're like, oh, this coaching thing is, like, much preferable to done for you. Should I just drop all my agency clients and then just, like, start doing coaching full time?\n\nAnd it's like, no. Because it has to be a transition. Otherwise, you end up going back to, like you lose just, like, ten k revenue like that. And at the end of the day, like, that's profit.\n\nYou know? So you don't wanna cut it out. So that makes sense. So your your goal, if I'm not mistaken, is, like, eighty grand, a hundred grand a month?\n\nMonth. Oh, hundred percent. Yeah. It's like for me, I I I don't even consider half a million a year a worthy milestone.\n\nYeah. And this has been also something I really appreciated your the mindset training in the in the program. It's truly excellent, because you want to get to a point where your current level of revenue is just something like, obviously, I'm making that. Like, for me, I just wanna be able to say, well, dude, twenty five is, like, the bare minimum.\n\nRight? It's like it's as you say, it should be disgusting to you to make twenty five k. Right? Yeah.\n\nSo for me, I wanna get to that point where hundred k a month is the new normal. Yeah. And that is that's the goal. Like, I I don't consider the five hundred or, like, forty k a month.\n\nThat's just a bit of a gradual change for me, and that will get me to, obviously, half a million. Yeah. That is just not enough anymore. Right?\n\nIt's just the million a year is, like, the next hygiene standards. And I just I just know that I can do it.\n\nCouple of obstacles in the way, but I'll get there.\n\nI think just just for everyone watching as well, as as you reference the mindset training, one of the the core mindset strategy we have in the program is, there's a fancy term for it. I won't go into too much detail. But, basically, what you celebrate is what you limit yourself at. So if you think that, like, ten k a month is, the be all and end all and the holy grail of income, that's all you're ever gonna make.\n\nBut if you see ten k a month as the worst possible thing that could ever happen to you, and what I mean by that is, like, you'd never dip below that amount. It would be like, you know, not flushing your toilet for three weeks. Like, it's a hygiene standard. Right?\n\nYou do it because it happens and, like, no matter what that it would be disgusting to not do that. It's a very good strategy because I and then we see that manifest like it has in you, for example, Michael, where you don't wanna just go from twenty five to fifty because you just see fifty. It's just like, it's just fifty, you know, and then you can you can move on. And that creates a lot of pain as well, and it's a really good thing to have.\n\nYep.\n\nThat's awesome, man.\n\nSo there's a couple a couple things. Now it's now it's time to see if I can get you to potentially sell my program for me.\n\nIf you were because I know you obviously you you had your hesitations about working with us and stuff, and it took you a while to come around to it. If you were thinking about booking a call or buying the program we've got, what advice would you give to that person knowing what you know now about the program?\n\nSo you have nothing to risk. Right? That's the great thing. This was ultimately the thing that got me over the line is that you offer this money back guarantee, which I've completely taken over.\n\nIt's I've I'm doing that myself now as well. And it's truly down to you to the question is whether you trust yourself enough that you will actually do the work. That is the only thing. Because when when you do the work, you will get results.\n\nThere's zero doubt about that. Like, it I you guys say that you had one refund, and that was only because you didn't have it in the terms and conditions at the time that people need to do the work. Right? So you don't do refunds.\n\nYou don't need to do them because, obviously, your system works. And so that is to me the single most clear no brainer that listen.\n\nIf you're not booking at least one to two sales calls a day I love the dramatic throat.\n\nYeah. No. No. I just wanted to so that you can edit this out.\n\nNo. It's a little bit it's it's fine. Doesn't matter. Keep it clean.\n\nIf you're not booking one to two sales calls a day, then do something so those do something so that you book those one to two sales calls a day. Yeah. And Charlie's program is just excellent because it provides excruciating level of detail, a truly outstanding world class mindset module, and you will get your results. And if you don't, you get your money back, you know, which is, again, extremely unlikely.\n\nSo there's zero reason. Like, if you think if and, also, that's the thing. I really like you as a guy. Right?\n\nAnd so But when you when you make someone an extra hundred grand a year, that does tend to, naturally manifest.\n\nNo. But I also liked you, and that's the thing. We met. We had a sales call back in March or April twenty twenty one.\n\nRight? And there, I was neutral towards you. You tried to sell me something. I said no because I was just mistaken about the type of the service, and then we just kind of lost touch.\n\nAnd then you started doing YouTube videos more frequently, and I started watching them. And I thought, jeez. This guy is really good in what he says. He's better than most other these type of gurus.\n\nAnd so I developed a strong affinity for you, and then it was just purely okay. It's just I will need to do it, obviously. Yeah. And it's just then the moment of when and and when it's the right time.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo, that was those were my my considerations. So there has to be a a level a degree of of of appreciation for the person. You need to like them.\n\nMhmm.\n\nRight? And so for that, I think the YouTube videos that you do are excellent because you really develop an affinity for for somebody personally.\n\nSo YouTube is, like, just a weapon.\n\nYeah. It is. Take when you take familiarity and risk reversal and combine them, like, it it's just, like, it just builds, like I've I always look at client acquisition and, like, everything we do, like, how can we build the most trust?\n\nAnd it's like, well, where do you get trust from? Well, you get it from you there's three things. Like, do you trust just do you trust yourself to do the work? Most people do.\n\nSo that's always taken out. And then it's like, well, do you trust the person running the program? Me, I for example. And then do you trust the program?\n\nAnd, like, if you wanna trust me, you just have to become familiar enough with me. That's how the brain works. But to trust the program, you have to recognize there's a guarantee in place. So when we marry a lot of familiarity with a guarantee, there's just so much trust that, like, people just how would you say no to someone that you like and that will give you back?\n\nBecause the other thing is that if you trust me, then you trust me to be honest with my guarantee. Yep. Because it's like, if you if you know that you trust me and that I'm telling the truth, then that's natural. Then when I tell you, I'll give you back your money.\n\nYou actually believe it. Whereas I see a lot of people these days offering guarantees and, like, I'll scale your agents to get ten k a month in the next three months, and if I don't, I'll give you all your money back. And you don't believe them. It's like, well, what's what's holding you accountable to that promise?\n\nIt's like you don't have a reputation or an audience to uphold, so there's nothing really sitting under that. So I think a lot of people think that, like, guarantees and offers create trust, and they do, but not as much as if you have familiarity with the person.\n\nBut Mhmm.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWell, I think we'll we'll close there.\n\nJust keep it short and sweet. I really do appreciate you taking the time, mate, and coming on board.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nHow can people find you?\n\nBecause I know you've got a YouTube channel as well. I could link that in the description if you like.\n\nYeah. Absolutely. So, the website is michael barnes dot com, Michael without an e. And we are you can find me on LinkedIn and, get in touch in that way.\n\nBeautiful, mate. Well, no doubt we'll be talking again in twelve months or so when you get to a hundred grand a month.\n\nI'll look for it.\n\nOh, yeah. What? Twelve months?\n\nOh, I'm gonna get there faster.\n\nYeah. Well, you haven't you haven't entered the realm of sales reps yet, my friend. Oh, yeah. Yeah.\n\nThat's where it's that's where you can Is that necessary?\n\nNo. For a hundred k a month, is that necessary?\n\nIt depends what sort of life you want.\n\nYeah. Yeah. You can can get no.\n\nYou can do a hundred k a month if you're just the one doing the calls. You can do a hundred fifty k a month if you're just the one doing the calls, but then all you do is calls. So it's like you don't feel like a business owner, but but either way. And it doesn't sustain itself because eventually you have to work on other things.\n\nBut we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. But, pleasure, man. I'll talk to you later. Thanks for watching, everyone.\n\nPeace."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}}, {});
