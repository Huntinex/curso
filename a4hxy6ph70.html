How's it going? It's Charlie Morgan here, and welcome back to another video for the channel or wherever else you might be watching this one. So today, I'm gonna be interviewing an awesome client of ours, guy called Martin.\n\nAnd Martin started working with us, just over six months ago, if I'm not mistaken, six, seven months ago. The UK based, marketing agency, down in the southwest close to me, actually. And Martin's added twenty seven thousand dollars, just shy of thirty thousand dollars in new monthly revenue to his agency since starting to work with us. And, the goal of today's interview stroke informal conversation is obviously to get to the bottom of this and, for Martin to sort of share his experience with everybody, and you guys so you guys can learn a bit more about our program and how it works, everything.\n\nSo, Martin, why don't you just start by introducing yourself and, telling us a bit about who you are and your agency?\n\nHi, Charlie. So, my name is Martin McAndrew, and I'm the director and founder of, an agency called BlueThirst.\n\nWe're based in sunny Bournemouth in the UK.\n\nWe work in the ecommerce sector, and we work with with clients that turn over between kind of one and five million, across lots of different strains of mostly ecommerce, but some other kind of slight slide shots of that as well.\n\nNice one. Awesome. So you you started with us about six months ago. And if I'm not mistaken, Martin, we we managed to land you through cold email. You did. I think so we we use the magic to get you on the call.\n\nSo before you started with us, obviously, now you sort of added a significant, you know, multi six figures a year to the to the business. Before you started with us, where were you at in your agency, and and what were what were you really struggling with?\n\nSo as an agency, we've always been really good at delivery of results. What we didn't have was a scalable way to grow new customers. So we knew if we if we wanna climb, what we could actually do for climb was great work. But what I really wanted was a plan that I could project, income with, and I could plan recruitment with, and I could plan growing an agency around something that was that was scalable. So if I put x effort in, I would get y results. So, so all of our work tended to come from referrals, tended to come from, you know, clients who have had good experiences passing the word on, but nothing that was really scalable.\n\nYeah. So what I really wanted was a process where if I wanted two new clients a month, I knew I needed to put certain amount of effort in, and that would return me two new clients a month. If I wanted four new clients a month, I would have to put twice as much effort in as two clients a month. That that was what I was really looking for.\n\nAnd and now that you've been working with us for six months, that sort of if I'm not mistaken, what you have in place is that predictability.\n\nYeah. Exactly right.\n\nYeah. Amazing. Because when I remember our call, all back in, what was it, like, summer of last year, and I think you were quite skeptical.\n\nIt took a a fair bit of objection handling to get you, over the line on the call. Had you tried, some sort of, like, program or other done for you appointment booking stuff before? If I'm not mistaken, you tried a few things that hadn't worked out.\n\nYeah. So we we'd taken on people who would, yeah, appointment book for us, who would do, yeah, cost per new client sign ups.\n\nMhmm.\n\nNothing kind of really works. Everything was kind of promised. I've done a few courses. So, yeah, I was I was skeptical. There's a lot of people out there that kinda promised the world.\n\nYeah. No. There's there's there's quite a few of them. We've been through a lot in our agency as well.\n\nSo, so let's sort of detail out the timeline then. So you basically you you come on board with us. You've got this problem. You're a bit skeptical.\n\nWe managed to get you over the line with with our guarantee and everything, which I'm sure was quite useful for you. And so you you hopped in. Now, obviously, we've got quite a fair bit of content and lots of different stuff, and we'll dive into what's been useful for you in a second. But what were your, like, sort of thoughts on the content in terms of how it unfolded for you and and when you started using it?\n\nYeah. So there there is a lot of great content, and it's a really good structured approach. What I found the most challenging was to just accept what you said and do what you say. Yeah.\n\nBecause a whole lot of stuff like we tested going after dentists as our first vertical sector, which was that was me not wanting to ruin ecommerce because that's what we normally work in. But, actually, you know, in in your videos, you you say don't swap between vertical sectors. Pick a vertical sector and nail it. And I think being the type of person I am, I was questioning everything.\n\nAnd once I actually shut my brain up and just write, well, let's you paid Charlie this money to do this course. Let's do what Charlie says. If we do what Charlie says and it still doesn't work, let's then go back to him. We can't what we can't do is not do what Charlie says and expect to get good results.\n\nSo it took me a little while just to get my head around the fact that, you know, this is a process that can work, but you've just gotta follow the process. If you try and freestyle it out and try and do your own bits within it, you're you're moving away from the from the optimal.\n\nAnd yeah. So, yeah, one once I actually followed the plan, put the commitment in, and it is, you know, it's it's not a small thing. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nIt's it's not business for free. It's you're not getting something for nothing. Yeah. It does take work.\n\nIt does take commitment, but, you know, that that's what growing a business is. Yeah.\n\nI think I think that's quite a common theme as well.\n\nIt's because we work with agency owners that have previously been burned by another course or a program or other done for you appointment setters. And they they come in, and they've got this they've got such skepticism around appointment booking. Their their belief system is so sort of, like, messed up with it because they believe it's really hard. And there's no way it's just a question of watching some videos and implementing some processes to to make it happen.\n\nYeah. And, yeah, you you started going for dentists, but I think you sort of then realized that it was ecommerce you wanted to go after. So before then, you you had amazing service delivery, but you had plateaued. You were struggling.\n\nNow you're in a position where you really can just think, okay. I want a client. I'm gonna send this amount of emails.\n\nIn terms of, like I don't wanna dig too much into this personally because this is an interview, and we're on YouTube and stuff. But how do you feel compared to, like, how it was going before and how it's going now?\n\nEmotionally, what's the difference for you as the owner of the business?\n\nYeah. I think I think previously, the issue that I had was no matter how hard I worked and how hard I tried new business, we just weren't getting growth. Mhmm. Now I know that, if I want new business, I have to do a certain number of tasks in a certain way.\n\nYou know, it's again, it's not easy. It's a lot of hard work. But, you know, if I want an extra five k next month, if that's what my forecast for next month is to deliver new business Yeah. I know what I need to do to deliver that.\n\nAnd the only way that I won't get that is if I don't do the work to get that five k's worth of work. So yeah. It it yeah. I I now know what I need to do to get the results that I need.\n\nWe we've forecasted twenty twenty two out, so I have billing targets for each month. So I know the jobs I need to do each month to hit that that billing target.\n\nThat's awesome. I guess it's just having that sort of predictability and clarity.\n\nYeah. Because I think for you can probably relate to this in those early days of running an agency when, like, you you can build to a certain point through goodwill and referrals, but then you really do hit this sort of cap and you exhaust your network, and then you're like, ah, but I want to keep growing, but I don't wanna be comfortable. And so, yeah, I totally hear you and input it to that. So your, what are your goals in terms of the business for this year? You don't have to be super specific in terms of, like, how much you want to make or what you forecasted, of course, but be good to understand, like, whether you want to double or triple or increase like Yeah. What what what does that look like?\n\nSo every month so every year for the next three years, we want to double business. So this year will be twice as big as last. The year after will be twice as big. So, yeah, that's our plan for the next three years is to double in size every year.\n\nMhmm. Amazing. And you talked earlier about how, like, service delivery has always been your advantage, and you're in the ecommerce space. Now as I'm sure you're probably aware, there's a lot of marketing agencies in the ecommerce space and also lead generation that's really struggled to keep clients and get results.\n\nWhat do you think separates you guys as an agency from other agencies in terms of maintaining these clients?\n\nProcess.\n\nSo, yeah, absolutely one of the things that kind of came out. We're kind of from this course and, you know, other things that we're working on as well is you you need processes, you know, that even down to the CRM system that you guys talk about with the reporting, if there's a problem and, yeah, we've had problems. I'm not I'm not gonna say it's all been smooth sailing, but, yeah, where we've seen a drop in results Yeah. Because you've got a process, you can identify where that issue is. So we were generating some data.\n\nWe had a a freelancer that was producing bad data for us. And within seven days of running that data, our conversion rate dropped off. But because we had the process to monitor that, we could go you know, you may have panicked and gone, is our video script wrong? Is our collateral wrong?\n\nIs this wrong? Is that wrong? But you look at it and you go, that data source has changed in the last seven days. That completely aligns with our drop in performance.\n\nSo we've kind of taken that and extrapolated it almost throughout the whole business now. So if if we're finding we have a set of process and a set of reports. Mhmm. If something's failing at some point, we've now got a metric that we can go, that's what's causing the issue.\n\nSo, yeah, it's applying that methodology to a whole business. And yeah.\n\nI think that's that's how, Beau and I we really like I mean, I see Imperium and our agency. We really just see our business as a set of spreadsheets.\n\nAbsolutely. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd when you can think in spreadsheets, which isn't an easy thing to do, it you can sort of just like a business is just a collection of numbers. Right? And all you have to do is know how to tweak one dial and decrease the other and read data properly. And I think it's definitely better than relying on emotion. So that's something you extrapolate. You you learn that from the Loom alchemy, I'm assuming, the Loom alchemy process.\n\nThe approach. Yeah.\n\nSo the the Loom thing, the cold email thing was, if I'm not mistaken, the main thing that you you built and set up.\n\nAnd that was the the the process that really contributed to this additional, you know, twenty, thirty grand in revenue. Yeah. In addition to that module, is there anything else from the program that you found to be really helpful? Maybe in terms of your mindset or business, it might might have just been the Loom thing course.\n\nBut Yeah.\n\nThe the Loom well, the Loom's what changed the lever. That's what tweaked the numbers.\n\nBut it was quite good, some of the pieces about mindset as well and kind of doing things that you don't really like.\n\nAnd, yeah, because it because your your mindset is what kinda drives everything.\n\nI always kinda wasn't really a believer of that in the last twelve months or so. I've kinda started to explore that a little bit more. And, actually, I'm saying, you know, one of the I think it was one of the bits you put about, you're always trying to live in your comfort zone. Yeah.\n\nAnd, actually, you know, you're if you're wanting to go out and achieve something, it's your body holding you back. And it's a natural you're if you're out in the fields, your body doesn't want to go into dangerous places. So it's a natural resource of your body to say, this might be dodgy. I don't think we should do it.\n\nAnd, actually, as a business owner, you kinda haven't got that luxury. If you want to grow, you need to go out into the wilds.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd the wilds can be scary. Your body's designed not to go to scary places. And as long as you can understand that's the metric, that's what's going on in your head, you can go, oh, right. You know, this is just my body trying to protect me and my mind trying to protect me, but it's actually where I need to go.\n\nI thought that was quite useful.\n\nYeah. I do think, like, biologically, if you'd like you know, we'd we'd we'd use or refer to this in the program as you've mentioned, but for everyone watching, just for the context, obviously, it's like you've got to realize that, like, as humans, as Homo sapiens, right, we were we were raised on these African plains and in coming across Europe and stuff all those all those years ago. You know? You can read Sapiens.\n\nIt's a good book. And I realized that when I read Sapiens. And it's like we are biologically like, our limbic system is designed to avoid pain, but also to treat anything that isn't in our current situation as as scary. Right?\n\nAs as a threat. Yeah.\n\nYeah. And so and there's a threat. And so your body, like, physically can't consciously tell the difference between you wanting to do outreach to grow and going over to that tree to climb up it and pick an apple. There might be a snake in there.\n\nRight? There really isn't. Like, obviously, when you think about it, there's, like, no way is that the case. But biologically speaking, like, it why would it not be?\n\nIt's the same sort of principle applies.\n\nAnd so, yeah, we'll we'll quite have your mindset, and I'm I'm glad you started to explore that because we've we find a lot, you know, we find that with Imperium, there's there's two types of agency owner. There's agency owners like yourself that that have been in business for a while. You're pretty seasoned, and you've got experience, and you you just haven't cracked the outbound code yet. But then we've also got agency owners who are really new to the game, and they're coming out of this freelance model, and they haven't got a team or any sort of experience. And, like, we find that, like, people in your situation have this advantage of experience, but then they also and this is not an insult anyway, but, like, they have the disadvantage of being sort of locked in the ways they've done things.\n\nAnd that Expectation. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd then that manifests itself in terms of, like, I bought this course, but I don't know if I believe what this guy is saying because I've never seen it work. Whereas with the freelancers, it's like they've got no experience, which means that there's it's more difficult for them to extrapolate things and put it into other parts of the business, and they're usually a lot more emotional as well, which is which is important.\n\nSo you've you've done the Loom thing. You've got that mindset sort of thing together. Did you do any of the sales module, or was that not really too much of a problem for you?\n\nYeah. So my my background is I'm I'm a techie. I became a freelancer. I then took staff on to handle I I've I've never been sales trained.\n\nSo the the sales training was actually quite useful.\n\nI before I kind of watched the videos, I thought a lot of sales training was just BS.\n\nBut actually Most of it most of it is to be fair.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut it's psychology, and it's it's human psychology. So it's I I approached it with an I I had to really approach this with an open mind because like like you said, the experience of having yeah. Being promised things and not delivering in the past was jading me. And once once we did the Lume alchemy and I never thought I'd be able to send a an email with a video to a big company and then to open it, reply to it, and have a meeting. I didn't think that would ever happen. It happens.\n\nIt's a mindset thing, isn't it?\n\nYou know? That's that's really because we we have that at the start of the, email stuff is the outreach epiphany is that main video on beliefs. And it's like, look. If you if you don't if you believe that booking appointments through cold email is hard, then you will make it hard because, as unions, we don't act in like, without accordance with our beliefs. And so we usually find that all you have to do is fix the beliefs, and then everything else just, like, just falls into place. Do Martin, do you so you you talked about team earlier.\n\nWith your agency, what does what's the team structure like at the moment?\n\nGrowing.\n\nGood. So yeah. So it's we're we're implementing kind of a a a management process, and we're looking to understand how I mean, I guess every marketing agency is gonna have the same problem that getting good talent in the business is hard and it's expensive.\n\nAnd we're looking at ways of of developing a team where, you know, we we've got clients that are spending ten grand a day on media that we've got suitably trained staff members that can handle that sort of budget spend.\n\nYeah. That that's kind of one of the challenges that comes out of the excess of the the Loom alchemy is you suddenly got this work Yeah. And you have so I mean, because it kinda goes right back to what we're talking about at the very beginning of the video. Yeah. You can probably get to half a mil on wings and a prayer quite easily. And by having a close team that works well, you could probably get there. If you wanna get beyond that, it's process.\n\nMhmm.\n\nThat that's what makes an agency get into the millions or the multiple millions is a good process and a good structure.\n\nAnd that's that's you know, as soon as you start getting into those numbers, it all becomes about process. It all becomes about the numbers that run a business, and that's that's the kind of phase that we're now that Loom Alchemy has pushed us into is, you know, we we're not just a small number of people in a room. We are a business with processes, with checks and sign offs and numbers, And it's taken us from yeah. A little agency, we were, you know, a lot smaller when we started.\n\nWe're now a lot bigger, and we're now going through all those issues that have Yeah.\n\nNo. Now you've got all these problems to face. You're welcome. Yeah.\n\nI see it. I see it.\n\nIt is it is such a it is such a good point, though, because, like, we we find with agencies is we you know?\n\nSo, like, everyone, they can't get clients. Right? And so we we give them this solution. It's like, okay.\n\nWell, here's how you get appointments. And then they get appointments, and then they're like, well, I don't know how to sell. And so we're like, okay. Well, here's the sales training.\n\nAnd then they get the sales training and they close clients, and they're like, I don't know how to onboard. And then it's like, okay. Well, here's an onboarding funnel. And then, you know, and then they onboard people, and they're like, oh, I don't know how to do service delivery or and they we give them that.\n\nAnd then, like, I don't know how to report, and we give them that. So, like, what I've learned is that, like, appointments is, like, like, to fix a business, you don't just have to get more appointments. Because, like, if you can have, like, the best appointment booking machine on the planet, but you'll never have a true long term wealth cash flow generating machine because it's holistic, and it's that's just one small piece of a huge puzzle.\n\nYep. And so, like, what what we are gonna be working on this year, this might be cool for you as well, is another module sort of at the start of the program, which is more sort of like agency foundations. We're gonna call it agency genesis.\n\nAnd the purpose of that will be to sort of change the way of thinking. And one of the main themes, and you you might you sort of just briefly touched on this, is that decentralized model. Because, like, what we realized is you can get from zero to five hundred k a year, and then you sort of have this hard limit. But that hard limit is put in place because everything runs through you. Absolutely. And there's only so much energy and time and cognitive output that you have as a person. And so, like, really getting from that point anywhere beyond that, you have to learn how to just release a bit of control, which I'm sure you might have had to Yeah.\n\nI mean, it it's it's blooming scary. You know? But for for a decade, I've the results that are coming have been down to me, and now I've got a reliable team. And, yeah, it's a scary thing to do, but there's a process to do it.\n\nEvery business that's got to that size has gone through it. There is a process to do it. And what I think is great about the the stuff that I've done with you guys is it documents that process. And, yeah, it it's you're not you're not the first person to have ever done this.\n\nIt's been done millions of times.\n\nWatch the videos and go through it and just implement what is suggested because that's what's done hundreds, thousands of times of businesses that have gone through it. Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nWhen you were when you were going through the content, because, obviously, like, we we try to discourage this sort of copy and paste approach because we've got these step by step instructions, and we follow the instructions. But along the way, we're like, okay. Well, here's a few example scripts, and here's some example copy, and here are some example subject lines. Come use your knowledge of your niche to amalgamate them together. Did did you take that sort of approach in in your in your systems, or did you sort of just, like, grab it and do what you wanted to do? Either way, it's fine because you still got the result. But yeah.\n\nYeah. So the way the way we did it is we we started very much with the template stuff.\n\nI'm quite lucky that I've got a couple of mentors that I use as well.\n\nSome of the guys have got lots of agency experience. Some of the guys have got lots of financial experience. Yeah. And I just sat down with them with the templates and went, right, what do you think of this?\n\nWe took their feedback and we amalgamated it all into into one script and one email. And interesting since we did that, which was five months ago, we've never updated the scripts, and we've never updated the emails. We've always run the same version. We've never needed to actually to change that.\n\nI think one of the things that I I'm very aware that I could get sucked into is changing things too quickly. And if you suddenly ever drop off, jumping Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. I think that's where the the data comes in. Yeah. Because, obviously, you know, as you're aware, for everyone watching, we've in the in the Loom section, and we've also got cold calling, cold messaging that you we'll touch in a second.\n\nIt's like we've got for every single system, we have data. Because I hear this a lot where, like, I'll go to an agency, and they'll be like, yeah. I've got a system for cold email. And I'm like, okay.\n\nWell, what's your positive reply rate? And then before they give you an answer, they're like, I'm like, well, it's not a system.\n\nYeah. Absolutely.\n\nAnything that isn't tracked isn't systemized.\n\nAnd so it allows you to keep yourself in check because, you know, one like, we have I still have this, like, where I'll open my email inbox and see no replies for like, from yesterday, and I'll be like, oh my god. Is the system broken? And I'm like, Charlie, chill the fuck out. It's one day.\n\nIt's not a rolling average. And then I go back in the next day, like, six of them, and I'm like, oh, it's just it was balancing itself out. The average is three a day. Yeah.\n\nDid you did you use any of the modules, other than Loom, like, specifically for appointment booking? Was that the main one?\n\nLoom was probably the main one. I kinda dipped in and out of the other ones, but, yeah, Loom was the main thing that we that we used.\n\nThat's awesome. That's amazing. So what are your objectives next then? So you scaled up. You've you've now got a predictable and reliable system for appointment booking.\n\nYou've got your forecast, and you've got everything. What's your what's on your to do list now? Like, when you look at your goals and your forecast, what's the sort of, like, focus for you next?\n\nSo we're we're refining the the whole pipeline again. So we're we've kind of gone through the life life steps of new client all the way through to them being a client. We're starting to understand the lifetime value of those customers. We're now taking that and plugging that back into the beginning again and saying, you know, we were lucky in the ecommerce clients between this size and this size in these sectors.\n\nBut actually, now we've done a few iterations of this. Are we putting the right people in the top of the funnel, and we're optimizing that. So we're trying to get into bigger businesses now. So we've we've moved our proposition slightly to a a larger business proposition and a slightly different, get target audience.\n\nYeah. That Amazing. I think you'll you'll find that Loom still works just as well at at those bigger companies.\n\nWe got a a guy who I will probably interview in the next couple of months called Jimmy, James. You may have seen him in the Facebook group or not. I'm not sure if you hang out there.\n\nBut he he signed a one hundred and ten thousand dollar deal I did see that.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nA month contract, and he's seven days into using looms.\n\nAnd that's really reassuring because I've seen we've got other agencies that do sell significantly higher ticket than one to two k a month retainers.\n\nAnd they're a lot the cool thing is they're a lot quieter.\n\nThey they typically, you find, like, yourself, like, we we I think we we didn't really hear from you much. And then I checked in with you one day, and you were like, oh, yeah. We've added, like, twenty, thirty grand in monthly revenue. I was like, oh, okay. Let's let's get an interview.\n\nAnd you sort of just just get down to work and and get to it, and that's awesome.\n\nBy the way, have you checked out the team building module in the program?\n\nBecause we did a might be useful for you for the team's I looked at a what some of the recruitment stuff.\n\nI need to go back in and yeah. The it we've we've got the work coming in, so the priorities have changed to delivering it and building the team. But, yeah, absolutely, I need to to Of course. Just keep learning, keep keep going through all that stuff.\n\nIf you if you have any other bottlenecks around it, just where a message is aware of coaching call question away.\n\nBut that's awesome. Well, I've got yeah. I don't I don't really have any other questions here. I just wanted to sort of understand, like because this is useful for me because it also allows me to see what people find to be the most valuable and what they're thinking and how they think about the program.\n\nIf if you were, you know, I I asked this in all the interviews. It's a bit of a loaded question because, obviously, I'm supposed to ask it. Right? But if if you were say if you were talking to someone who ran an agency, who was really skeptical of of us or just the the course in general as everyone tends to be, of course, is If you was could say something to that person and they were thinking, do I buy this or not?\n\nWhat would you say to them?\n\nYeah. I gotta admit, I I was in exactly the same position. I didn't think that a large, limited business would open an email from a Gmail account, watch a video that I'd put together, and then book through a calendar link an appointment with me. Didn't think it would happen.\n\nI was in a position where we had a little bit of cash. I thought, well, you know what? Let's put this in. If I lose it, it's just another lesson that I can chalk down to experience.\n\nAnd within, yeah, within the first month, I was getting appointments and improving. And, yeah, it I I still can't believe that big limited companies would open this one through a video and book it. Even though we're doing I'm getting the results, but, yeah, it it it is working.\n\nThat's amazing. Well, we'll we'll leave it there, Martin, because I I know you're a super busy man. You've no doubt you've got some lovely sunshine to enjoy down in Bournemouth. Is it is it gray? It's really gray up here in Bristol at the moment. I'm sure it's sunny down there.\n\nI think it is.\n\nYeah. I think it's just quite cold and over overcast today.\n\nWe'll be in we'll be into spring soon, which, which I'm really looking forward to.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Well, we'll conclude with that.\n\nNow one thing I will ask is if by any chance there's an ecommerce store watching who might want to talk to you and your agency, how could they connect with you, or what's the best way to people Yeah.\n\nThe easiest way, inevitably, first dot co dot UK.\n\nThe all of our contact details are there. Or I'm Martin McAndrew. I'm on LinkedIn, Twitter, all the usual places. Do reach out. Yeah. I'm more than happy to have a chance.\n\nThat's Blue First, like the color blue, and then thirsty if I'm drinking water.\n\nDon't drink.\n\nYeah. I I was I was training for a channel swim. So I was in the blue, the sea a lot. And because I'm diabetic, I was doing it for diabetes UK. I was thirsty a lot.\n\nSo I found found the domain existed and and got there. Got it. Did you swim?\n\nDid you swim the channel?\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nNo. Oh, dear.\n\nI was, reading Ross Edgley's, book about him swimming around the whole of the UK, and I was like Same.\n\nI can't even swim, like, three lengths of a pool. So, good on you.\n\nIt's the same mindset to doing eighty loom videos in a in a straight go. It's the same. You do it if it's gonna be horrible. It's gonna hurt, but you've gotta do it if you wanna get to the other side.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Exactly. And we're not on African plains anymore. We're in, twenty second century with with fridges and microwaves, so we're all gonna be there.\n\nBut we'll we'll call it a day then, Martin. Greatly appreciate your time, and, hopefully, we can do another call like this in six to twelve months when you've, you know, scaled an extra fifty grand or so, which I have no doubt we'll we'll be able to do.\n\nYeah. From the from the lead, yeah.\n\nAwesome, mate. Talk to you soon. Take care. Awesome.\n\nCheers, mate.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/a4hxy6ph70?autoplay=0&wmode=transparent&wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

How's it going? It's Charlie Morgan here, and welcome back to another video for the channel or wherever else you might be watching this one. So today, I'm gonna be interviewing an awesome client of ours, guy called Martin.\n\nAnd Martin started working with us, just over six months ago, if I'm not mistaken, six, seven months ago. The UK based, marketing agency, down in the southwest close to me, actually. And Martin's added twenty seven thousand dollars, just shy of thirty thousand dollars in new monthly revenue to his agency since starting to work with us. And, the goal of today's interview stroke informal conversation is obviously to get to the bottom of this and, for Martin to sort of share his experience with everybody, and you guys so you guys can learn a bit more about our program and how it works, everything.\n\nSo, Martin, why don't you just start by introducing yourself and, telling us a bit about who you are and your agency?\n\nHi, Charlie. So, my name is Martin McAndrew, and I'm the director and founder of, an agency called BlueThirst.\n\nWe're based in sunny Bournemouth in the UK.\n\nWe work in the ecommerce sector, and we work with with clients that turn over between kind of one and five million, across lots of different strains of mostly ecommerce, but some other kind of slight slide shots of that as well.\n\nNice one. Awesome. So you you started with us about six months ago. And if I'm not mistaken, Martin, we we managed to land you through cold email. You did. I think so we we use the magic to get you on the call.\n\nSo before you started with us, obviously, now you sort of added a significant, you know, multi six figures a year to the to the business. Before you started with us, where were you at in your agency, and and what were what were you really struggling with?\n\nSo as an agency, we've always been really good at delivery of results. What we didn't have was a scalable way to grow new customers. So we knew if we if we wanna climb, what we could actually do for climb was great work. But what I really wanted was a plan that I could project, income with, and I could plan recruitment with, and I could plan growing an agency around something that was that was scalable. So if I put x effort in, I would get y results. So, so all of our work tended to come from referrals, tended to come from, you know, clients who have had good experiences passing the word on, but nothing that was really scalable.\n\nYeah. So what I really wanted was a process where if I wanted two new clients a month, I knew I needed to put certain amount of effort in, and that would return me two new clients a month. If I wanted four new clients a month, I would have to put twice as much effort in as two clients a month. That that was what I was really looking for.\n\nAnd and now that you've been working with us for six months, that sort of if I'm not mistaken, what you have in place is that predictability.\n\nYeah. Exactly right.\n\nYeah. Amazing. Because when I remember our call, all back in, what was it, like, summer of last year, and I think you were quite skeptical.\n\nIt took a a fair bit of objection handling to get you, over the line on the call. Had you tried, some sort of, like, program or other done for you appointment booking stuff before? If I'm not mistaken, you tried a few things that hadn't worked out.\n\nYeah. So we we'd taken on people who would, yeah, appointment book for us, who would do, yeah, cost per new client sign ups.\n\nMhmm.\n\nNothing kind of really works. Everything was kind of promised. I've done a few courses. So, yeah, I was I was skeptical. There's a lot of people out there that kinda promised the world.\n\nYeah. No. There's there's there's quite a few of them. We've been through a lot in our agency as well.\n\nSo, so let's sort of detail out the timeline then. So you basically you you come on board with us. You've got this problem. You're a bit skeptical.\n\nWe managed to get you over the line with with our guarantee and everything, which I'm sure was quite useful for you. And so you you hopped in. Now, obviously, we've got quite a fair bit of content and lots of different stuff, and we'll dive into what's been useful for you in a second. But what were your, like, sort of thoughts on the content in terms of how it unfolded for you and and when you started using it?\n\nYeah. So there there is a lot of great content, and it's a really good structured approach. What I found the most challenging was to just accept what you said and do what you say. Yeah.\n\nBecause a whole lot of stuff like we tested going after dentists as our first vertical sector, which was that was me not wanting to ruin ecommerce because that's what we normally work in. But, actually, you know, in in your videos, you you say don't swap between vertical sectors. Pick a vertical sector and nail it. And I think being the type of person I am, I was questioning everything.\n\nAnd once I actually shut my brain up and just write, well, let's you paid Charlie this money to do this course. Let's do what Charlie says. If we do what Charlie says and it still doesn't work, let's then go back to him. We can't what we can't do is not do what Charlie says and expect to get good results.\n\nSo it took me a little while just to get my head around the fact that, you know, this is a process that can work, but you've just gotta follow the process. If you try and freestyle it out and try and do your own bits within it, you're you're moving away from the from the optimal.\n\nAnd yeah. So, yeah, one once I actually followed the plan, put the commitment in, and it is, you know, it's it's not a small thing. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nIt's it's not business for free. It's you're not getting something for nothing. Yeah. It does take work.\n\nIt does take commitment, but, you know, that that's what growing a business is. Yeah.\n\nI think I think that's quite a common theme as well.\n\nIt's because we work with agency owners that have previously been burned by another course or a program or other done for you appointment setters. And they they come in, and they've got this they've got such skepticism around appointment booking. Their their belief system is so sort of, like, messed up with it because they believe it's really hard. And there's no way it's just a question of watching some videos and implementing some processes to to make it happen.\n\nYeah. And, yeah, you you started going for dentists, but I think you sort of then realized that it was ecommerce you wanted to go after. So before then, you you had amazing service delivery, but you had plateaued. You were struggling.\n\nNow you're in a position where you really can just think, okay. I want a client. I'm gonna send this amount of emails.\n\nIn terms of, like I don't wanna dig too much into this personally because this is an interview, and we're on YouTube and stuff. But how do you feel compared to, like, how it was going before and how it's going now?\n\nEmotionally, what's the difference for you as the owner of the business?\n\nYeah. I think I think previously, the issue that I had was no matter how hard I worked and how hard I tried new business, we just weren't getting growth. Mhmm. Now I know that, if I want new business, I have to do a certain number of tasks in a certain way.\n\nYou know, it's again, it's not easy. It's a lot of hard work. But, you know, if I want an extra five k next month, if that's what my forecast for next month is to deliver new business Yeah. I know what I need to do to deliver that.\n\nAnd the only way that I won't get that is if I don't do the work to get that five k's worth of work. So yeah. It it yeah. I I now know what I need to do to get the results that I need.\n\nWe we've forecasted twenty twenty two out, so I have billing targets for each month. So I know the jobs I need to do each month to hit that that billing target.\n\nThat's awesome. I guess it's just having that sort of predictability and clarity.\n\nYeah. Because I think for you can probably relate to this in those early days of running an agency when, like, you you can build to a certain point through goodwill and referrals, but then you really do hit this sort of cap and you exhaust your network, and then you're like, ah, but I want to keep growing, but I don't wanna be comfortable. And so, yeah, I totally hear you and input it to that. So your, what are your goals in terms of the business for this year? You don't have to be super specific in terms of, like, how much you want to make or what you forecasted, of course, but be good to understand, like, whether you want to double or triple or increase like Yeah. What what what does that look like?\n\nSo every month so every year for the next three years, we want to double business. So this year will be twice as big as last. The year after will be twice as big. So, yeah, that's our plan for the next three years is to double in size every year.\n\nMhmm. Amazing. And you talked earlier about how, like, service delivery has always been your advantage, and you're in the ecommerce space. Now as I'm sure you're probably aware, there's a lot of marketing agencies in the ecommerce space and also lead generation that's really struggled to keep clients and get results.\n\nWhat do you think separates you guys as an agency from other agencies in terms of maintaining these clients?\n\nProcess.\n\nSo, yeah, absolutely one of the things that kind of came out. We're kind of from this course and, you know, other things that we're working on as well is you you need processes, you know, that even down to the CRM system that you guys talk about with the reporting, if there's a problem and, yeah, we've had problems. I'm not I'm not gonna say it's all been smooth sailing, but, yeah, where we've seen a drop in results Yeah. Because you've got a process, you can identify where that issue is. So we were generating some data.\n\nWe had a a freelancer that was producing bad data for us. And within seven days of running that data, our conversion rate dropped off. But because we had the process to monitor that, we could go you know, you may have panicked and gone, is our video script wrong? Is our collateral wrong?\n\nIs this wrong? Is that wrong? But you look at it and you go, that data source has changed in the last seven days. That completely aligns with our drop in performance.\n\nSo we've kind of taken that and extrapolated it almost throughout the whole business now. So if if we're finding we have a set of process and a set of reports. Mhmm. If something's failing at some point, we've now got a metric that we can go, that's what's causing the issue.\n\nSo, yeah, it's applying that methodology to a whole business. And yeah.\n\nI think that's that's how, Beau and I we really like I mean, I see Imperium and our agency. We really just see our business as a set of spreadsheets.\n\nAbsolutely. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd when you can think in spreadsheets, which isn't an easy thing to do, it you can sort of just like a business is just a collection of numbers. Right? And all you have to do is know how to tweak one dial and decrease the other and read data properly. And I think it's definitely better than relying on emotion. So that's something you extrapolate. You you learn that from the Loom alchemy, I'm assuming, the Loom alchemy process.\n\nThe approach. Yeah.\n\nSo the the Loom thing, the cold email thing was, if I'm not mistaken, the main thing that you you built and set up.\n\nAnd that was the the the process that really contributed to this additional, you know, twenty, thirty grand in revenue. Yeah. In addition to that module, is there anything else from the program that you found to be really helpful? Maybe in terms of your mindset or business, it might might have just been the Loom thing course.\n\nBut Yeah.\n\nThe the Loom well, the Loom's what changed the lever. That's what tweaked the numbers.\n\nBut it was quite good, some of the pieces about mindset as well and kind of doing things that you don't really like.\n\nAnd, yeah, because it because your your mindset is what kinda drives everything.\n\nI always kinda wasn't really a believer of that in the last twelve months or so. I've kinda started to explore that a little bit more. And, actually, I'm saying, you know, one of the I think it was one of the bits you put about, you're always trying to live in your comfort zone. Yeah.\n\nAnd, actually, you know, you're if you're wanting to go out and achieve something, it's your body holding you back. And it's a natural you're if you're out in the fields, your body doesn't want to go into dangerous places. So it's a natural resource of your body to say, this might be dodgy. I don't think we should do it.\n\nAnd, actually, as a business owner, you kinda haven't got that luxury. If you want to grow, you need to go out into the wilds.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd the wilds can be scary. Your body's designed not to go to scary places. And as long as you can understand that's the metric, that's what's going on in your head, you can go, oh, right. You know, this is just my body trying to protect me and my mind trying to protect me, but it's actually where I need to go.\n\nI thought that was quite useful.\n\nYeah. I do think, like, biologically, if you'd like you know, we'd we'd we'd use or refer to this in the program as you've mentioned, but for everyone watching, just for the context, obviously, it's like you've got to realize that, like, as humans, as Homo sapiens, right, we were we were raised on these African plains and in coming across Europe and stuff all those all those years ago. You know? You can read Sapiens.\n\nIt's a good book. And I realized that when I read Sapiens. And it's like we are biologically like, our limbic system is designed to avoid pain, but also to treat anything that isn't in our current situation as as scary. Right?\n\nAs as a threat. Yeah.\n\nYeah. And so and there's a threat. And so your body, like, physically can't consciously tell the difference between you wanting to do outreach to grow and going over to that tree to climb up it and pick an apple. There might be a snake in there.\n\nRight? There really isn't. Like, obviously, when you think about it, there's, like, no way is that the case. But biologically speaking, like, it why would it not be?\n\nIt's the same sort of principle applies.\n\nAnd so, yeah, we'll we'll quite have your mindset, and I'm I'm glad you started to explore that because we've we find a lot, you know, we find that with Imperium, there's there's two types of agency owner. There's agency owners like yourself that that have been in business for a while. You're pretty seasoned, and you've got experience, and you you just haven't cracked the outbound code yet. But then we've also got agency owners who are really new to the game, and they're coming out of this freelance model, and they haven't got a team or any sort of experience. And, like, we find that, like, people in your situation have this advantage of experience, but then they also and this is not an insult anyway, but, like, they have the disadvantage of being sort of locked in the ways they've done things.\n\nAnd that Expectation. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd then that manifests itself in terms of, like, I bought this course, but I don't know if I believe what this guy is saying because I've never seen it work. Whereas with the freelancers, it's like they've got no experience, which means that there's it's more difficult for them to extrapolate things and put it into other parts of the business, and they're usually a lot more emotional as well, which is which is important.\n\nSo you've you've done the Loom thing. You've got that mindset sort of thing together. Did you do any of the sales module, or was that not really too much of a problem for you?\n\nYeah. So my my background is I'm I'm a techie. I became a freelancer. I then took staff on to handle I I've I've never been sales trained.\n\nSo the the sales training was actually quite useful.\n\nI before I kind of watched the videos, I thought a lot of sales training was just BS.\n\nBut actually Most of it most of it is to be fair.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut it's psychology, and it's it's human psychology. So it's I I approached it with an I I had to really approach this with an open mind because like like you said, the experience of having yeah. Being promised things and not delivering in the past was jading me. And once once we did the Lume alchemy and I never thought I'd be able to send a an email with a video to a big company and then to open it, reply to it, and have a meeting. I didn't think that would ever happen. It happens.\n\nIt's a mindset thing, isn't it?\n\nYou know? That's that's really because we we have that at the start of the, email stuff is the outreach epiphany is that main video on beliefs. And it's like, look. If you if you don't if you believe that booking appointments through cold email is hard, then you will make it hard because, as unions, we don't act in like, without accordance with our beliefs. And so we usually find that all you have to do is fix the beliefs, and then everything else just, like, just falls into place. Do Martin, do you so you you talked about team earlier.\n\nWith your agency, what does what's the team structure like at the moment?\n\nGrowing.\n\nGood. So yeah. So it's we're we're implementing kind of a a a management process, and we're looking to understand how I mean, I guess every marketing agency is gonna have the same problem that getting good talent in the business is hard and it's expensive.\n\nAnd we're looking at ways of of developing a team where, you know, we we've got clients that are spending ten grand a day on media that we've got suitably trained staff members that can handle that sort of budget spend.\n\nYeah. That that's kind of one of the challenges that comes out of the excess of the the Loom alchemy is you suddenly got this work Yeah. And you have so I mean, because it kinda goes right back to what we're talking about at the very beginning of the video. Yeah. You can probably get to half a mil on wings and a prayer quite easily. And by having a close team that works well, you could probably get there. If you wanna get beyond that, it's process.\n\nMhmm.\n\nThat that's what makes an agency get into the millions or the multiple millions is a good process and a good structure.\n\nAnd that's that's you know, as soon as you start getting into those numbers, it all becomes about process. It all becomes about the numbers that run a business, and that's that's the kind of phase that we're now that Loom Alchemy has pushed us into is, you know, we we're not just a small number of people in a room. We are a business with processes, with checks and sign offs and numbers, And it's taken us from yeah. A little agency, we were, you know, a lot smaller when we started.\n\nWe're now a lot bigger, and we're now going through all those issues that have Yeah.\n\nNo. Now you've got all these problems to face. You're welcome. Yeah.\n\nI see it. I see it.\n\nIt is it is such a it is such a good point, though, because, like, we we find with agencies is we you know?\n\nSo, like, everyone, they can't get clients. Right? And so we we give them this solution. It's like, okay.\n\nWell, here's how you get appointments. And then they get appointments, and then they're like, well, I don't know how to sell. And so we're like, okay. Well, here's the sales training.\n\nAnd then they get the sales training and they close clients, and they're like, I don't know how to onboard. And then it's like, okay. Well, here's an onboarding funnel. And then, you know, and then they onboard people, and they're like, oh, I don't know how to do service delivery or and they we give them that.\n\nAnd then, like, I don't know how to report, and we give them that. So, like, what I've learned is that, like, appointments is, like, like, to fix a business, you don't just have to get more appointments. Because, like, if you can have, like, the best appointment booking machine on the planet, but you'll never have a true long term wealth cash flow generating machine because it's holistic, and it's that's just one small piece of a huge puzzle.\n\nYep. And so, like, what what we are gonna be working on this year, this might be cool for you as well, is another module sort of at the start of the program, which is more sort of like agency foundations. We're gonna call it agency genesis.\n\nAnd the purpose of that will be to sort of change the way of thinking. And one of the main themes, and you you might you sort of just briefly touched on this, is that decentralized model. Because, like, what we realized is you can get from zero to five hundred k a year, and then you sort of have this hard limit. But that hard limit is put in place because everything runs through you. Absolutely. And there's only so much energy and time and cognitive output that you have as a person. And so, like, really getting from that point anywhere beyond that, you have to learn how to just release a bit of control, which I'm sure you might have had to Yeah.\n\nI mean, it it's it's blooming scary. You know? But for for a decade, I've the results that are coming have been down to me, and now I've got a reliable team. And, yeah, it's a scary thing to do, but there's a process to do it.\n\nEvery business that's got to that size has gone through it. There is a process to do it. And what I think is great about the the stuff that I've done with you guys is it documents that process. And, yeah, it it's you're not you're not the first person to have ever done this.\n\nIt's been done millions of times.\n\nWatch the videos and go through it and just implement what is suggested because that's what's done hundreds, thousands of times of businesses that have gone through it. Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nWhen you were when you were going through the content, because, obviously, like, we we try to discourage this sort of copy and paste approach because we've got these step by step instructions, and we follow the instructions. But along the way, we're like, okay. Well, here's a few example scripts, and here's some example copy, and here are some example subject lines. Come use your knowledge of your niche to amalgamate them together. Did did you take that sort of approach in in your in your systems, or did you sort of just, like, grab it and do what you wanted to do? Either way, it's fine because you still got the result. But yeah.\n\nYeah. So the way the way we did it is we we started very much with the template stuff.\n\nI'm quite lucky that I've got a couple of mentors that I use as well.\n\nSome of the guys have got lots of agency experience. Some of the guys have got lots of financial experience. Yeah. And I just sat down with them with the templates and went, right, what do you think of this?\n\nWe took their feedback and we amalgamated it all into into one script and one email. And interesting since we did that, which was five months ago, we've never updated the scripts, and we've never updated the emails. We've always run the same version. We've never needed to actually to change that.\n\nI think one of the things that I I'm very aware that I could get sucked into is changing things too quickly. And if you suddenly ever drop off, jumping Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. I think that's where the the data comes in. Yeah. Because, obviously, you know, as you're aware, for everyone watching, we've in the in the Loom section, and we've also got cold calling, cold messaging that you we'll touch in a second.\n\nIt's like we've got for every single system, we have data. Because I hear this a lot where, like, I'll go to an agency, and they'll be like, yeah. I've got a system for cold email. And I'm like, okay.\n\nWell, what's your positive reply rate? And then before they give you an answer, they're like, I'm like, well, it's not a system.\n\nYeah. Absolutely.\n\nAnything that isn't tracked isn't systemized.\n\nAnd so it allows you to keep yourself in check because, you know, one like, we have I still have this, like, where I'll open my email inbox and see no replies for like, from yesterday, and I'll be like, oh my god. Is the system broken? And I'm like, Charlie, chill the fuck out. It's one day.\n\nIt's not a rolling average. And then I go back in the next day, like, six of them, and I'm like, oh, it's just it was balancing itself out. The average is three a day. Yeah.\n\nDid you did you use any of the modules, other than Loom, like, specifically for appointment booking? Was that the main one?\n\nLoom was probably the main one. I kinda dipped in and out of the other ones, but, yeah, Loom was the main thing that we that we used.\n\nThat's awesome. That's amazing. So what are your objectives next then? So you scaled up. You've you've now got a predictable and reliable system for appointment booking.\n\nYou've got your forecast, and you've got everything. What's your what's on your to do list now? Like, when you look at your goals and your forecast, what's the sort of, like, focus for you next?\n\nSo we're we're refining the the whole pipeline again. So we're we've kind of gone through the life life steps of new client all the way through to them being a client. We're starting to understand the lifetime value of those customers. We're now taking that and plugging that back into the beginning again and saying, you know, we were lucky in the ecommerce clients between this size and this size in these sectors.\n\nBut actually, now we've done a few iterations of this. Are we putting the right people in the top of the funnel, and we're optimizing that. So we're trying to get into bigger businesses now. So we've we've moved our proposition slightly to a a larger business proposition and a slightly different, get target audience.\n\nYeah. That Amazing. I think you'll you'll find that Loom still works just as well at at those bigger companies.\n\nWe got a a guy who I will probably interview in the next couple of months called Jimmy, James. You may have seen him in the Facebook group or not. I'm not sure if you hang out there.\n\nBut he he signed a one hundred and ten thousand dollar deal I did see that.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nA month contract, and he's seven days into using looms.\n\nAnd that's really reassuring because I've seen we've got other agencies that do sell significantly higher ticket than one to two k a month retainers.\n\nAnd they're a lot the cool thing is they're a lot quieter.\n\nThey they typically, you find, like, yourself, like, we we I think we we didn't really hear from you much. And then I checked in with you one day, and you were like, oh, yeah. We've added, like, twenty, thirty grand in monthly revenue. I was like, oh, okay. Let's let's get an interview.\n\nAnd you sort of just just get down to work and and get to it, and that's awesome.\n\nBy the way, have you checked out the team building module in the program?\n\nBecause we did a might be useful for you for the team's I looked at a what some of the recruitment stuff.\n\nI need to go back in and yeah. The it we've we've got the work coming in, so the priorities have changed to delivering it and building the team. But, yeah, absolutely, I need to to Of course. Just keep learning, keep keep going through all that stuff.\n\nIf you if you have any other bottlenecks around it, just where a message is aware of coaching call question away.\n\nBut that's awesome. Well, I've got yeah. I don't I don't really have any other questions here. I just wanted to sort of understand, like because this is useful for me because it also allows me to see what people find to be the most valuable and what they're thinking and how they think about the program.\n\nIf if you were, you know, I I asked this in all the interviews. It's a bit of a loaded question because, obviously, I'm supposed to ask it. Right? But if if you were say if you were talking to someone who ran an agency, who was really skeptical of of us or just the the course in general as everyone tends to be, of course, is If you was could say something to that person and they were thinking, do I buy this or not?\n\nWhat would you say to them?\n\nYeah. I gotta admit, I I was in exactly the same position. I didn't think that a large, limited business would open an email from a Gmail account, watch a video that I'd put together, and then book through a calendar link an appointment with me. Didn't think it would happen.\n\nI was in a position where we had a little bit of cash. I thought, well, you know what? Let's put this in. If I lose it, it's just another lesson that I can chalk down to experience.\n\nAnd within, yeah, within the first month, I was getting appointments and improving. And, yeah, it I I still can't believe that big limited companies would open this one through a video and book it. Even though we're doing I'm getting the results, but, yeah, it it it is working.\n\nThat's amazing. Well, we'll we'll leave it there, Martin, because I I know you're a super busy man. You've no doubt you've got some lovely sunshine to enjoy down in Bournemouth. Is it is it gray? It's really gray up here in Bristol at the moment. I'm sure it's sunny down there.\n\nI think it is.\n\nYeah. I think it's just quite cold and over overcast today.\n\nWe'll be in we'll be into spring soon, which, which I'm really looking forward to.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Well, we'll conclude with that.\n\nNow one thing I will ask is if by any chance there's an ecommerce store watching who might want to talk to you and your agency, how could they connect with you, or what's the best way to people Yeah.\n\nThe easiest way, inevitably, first dot co dot UK.\n\nThe all of our contact details are there. Or I'm Martin McAndrew. I'm on LinkedIn, Twitter, all the usual places. Do reach out. Yeah. I'm more than happy to have a chance.\n\nThat's Blue First, like the color blue, and then thirsty if I'm drinking water.\n\nDon't drink.\n\nYeah. I I was I was training for a channel swim. So I was in the blue, the sea a lot. And because I'm diabetic, I was doing it for diabetes UK. I was thirsty a lot.\n\nSo I found found the domain existed and and got there. Got it. Did you swim?\n\nDid you swim the channel?\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nNo. Oh, dear.\n\nI was, reading Ross Edgley's, book about him swimming around the whole of the UK, and I was like Same.\n\nI can't even swim, like, three lengths of a pool. So, good on you.\n\nIt's the same mindset to doing eighty loom videos in a in a straight go. It's the same. You do it if it's gonna be horrible. It's gonna hurt, but you've gotta do it if you wanna get to the other side.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Exactly. And we're not on African plains anymore. We're in, twenty second century with with fridges and microwaves, so we're all gonna be there.\n\nBut we'll we'll call it a day then, Martin. Greatly appreciate your time, and, hopefully, we can do another call like this in six to twelve months when you've, you know, scaled an extra fifty grand or so, which I have no doubt we'll we'll be able to do.\n\nYeah. From the from the lead, yeah.\n\nAwesome, mate. Talk to you soon. Take care. Awesome.\n\nCheers, mate."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}}, {});
