Perfect.\n\nOh, so anyone and everyone that's watching this, this is Tibalt. Is it Tibalt or Thibault?\n\nThibault.\n\nThibault. Okay. There we go. First time.\n\nYou think I know it by now after all these months.\n\nBut, yeah, man, I want you to introduce yourself, what you do, what you sell, who you sell to, just a little bit of context before we jump into everything.\n\nSure.\n\nSo, I'm, Thibault. I'm thirty, and, I'm in the crypto investment for a while now. For seven years, I started investing in twenty sixteen while I was still working in a big company, back in time.\n\nThen I started doing some, entrepreneur stuff online. So I did different things, things that were working, things that didn't work, things that worked that I stopped because I didn't like, or stuff like that, you know.\n\nAnd then I started creating content. So back in twenty twenty, there was, like, the beginning of the last bull market, in crypto, and I started, like, advising my friend about crypto because they they knew I I knew. And so one of my friend made a lot of money back in back in time. He had, like, two million to invest, and he called me.\n\nHe was like, okay, Thibault. If I wanna invest, like, twenty percent of that capital in crypto, what should I do? And that guy was, like, a huge YouTuber in China. He was, like, one of the biggest YouTuber in China.\n\nThat's how he made his money. He's French, by the way, but speak Chinese perfectly.\n\nAnd, while I was on the phone with him, he was like, man, you should really do videos about crypto because you know the the subject. There are not so many people online. So, yeah, why don't you do video about crypto? And that's how I started. And now I have, like, more than six hundred thousand followers on different social network.\n\nTikTok, I started with short content. I started with TikTok when it was a small thing. That's how my account exploded. So I have, like, five hundred forty thousand on TikTok. I have, like, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, a newsletter.\n\nAnd, I'm selling a course and coaching about crypto, like crypto investment and airdrops, how to position yourself before everybody know a crypto, how to hedge your risk, how to invest with a proper strategy and exit the market before everybody everything goes wrong. You know? Mhmm.\n\nAnd then if if if I'm right to remember, it's exclusively in French in the French market. Right?\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. French speaking.\n\nYeah. So you joined us around, like, three, four months ago. Like, where were you at, before you joined? You had, like, version one of the program.\n\nI'm struggling to remember, you know, the exact details of where you were at.\n\nYeah. So I had the v one of the program that I launched in twenty twenty one.\n\nAnd then, I wanted to work on the v two.\n\nThen I wanted to launch a v two, and the v one I did and launch it with a webinar strategy back in time, like the Russell Brunson strategy webinar, and no ads, just organic. I did some videos, bring a lot of people in the webinar, and, started my course with, like, sell before build. So I sold the course, and then I built it.\n\nAnd people were happy about it.\n\nAnd then I stopped. That was my biggest mistake. I stopped sending it for some reason. I don't know why, actually. I wanted to I had, like, a shiny object syndrome. I wanted to do an agency helping, like, Web three founder do, like, marketing.\n\nAnd then I realized that, it's not so shiny to do that kind of business. In my opinion, it was not what I liked the most. And so then, after doing after realizing that I was subject to the shiny oblique syndrome for two years, I was still doing some business, working with some brands, doing some partnership and stuff. I really wanted to refocus on the course, which was, like, the thing I really enjoy doing.\n\nAnd so I refocused on the course. And when I booked that call with you, I was already following, Easy Growth Strategy and Charlie Morgan, YouTube channel for, like, a few months.\n\nAnd, yeah, that's that's why I booked actually because I wanted to I wanted a clear path. I knew I I know a lot of people doing business, online, and everybody has a different strategy.\n\nAnd, when you have your strategy and then someone else come with, like, you're showing you amazing result with another strategy, you attempted to move that strategy. And I really wanted to have, like, a clear path a clear path from some people that are making a lot of money and having good results and just follow the path. And that's also why I booked the the call with you, actually.\n\nMhmm. And, since we're talking about the call, I'm like, man, it was a long call. Right? It was an hour and a an hour and a half.\n\nTwo hours, I think, even.\n\nTwo hours? Wow.\n\nMaybe maybe less. Maybe less. Yeah. But, yeah, it was an on call.\n\nI haven't I haven't figured out my camera here. I can't figure out how to get it to auto adjust just yet.\n\nSo I have to manually switch when the sun comes out. Anyway, it was a it was a long call, and you had your objections. So, you know, having watched Charlie and knowing that you wanted that kind of process, what do you think was holding you back at the time right there?\n\nWhat was holding me back was, that I knew another guy that was doing also, like, a course mastermind stuff that I I know is working well, but it's a total different strategy. It's more based on webinar and ads, which is more like a Russell Brunson style. You do webinar every week, and you power that webinar with a lot of ads. Mhmm. And so, yeah, that was the I had to make I had to make a choice between between the two. And, yeah, that's why I think I was thinking that much during the call.\n\nMakes sense, man. Glad we got you in. Right? I think it's, like, a kind of contrast.\n\nWhat are you doing now in terms of revenue, in terms of numbers of the business?\n\nYeah. So I subscribed end of October, then in, I think, in November. So I I still had, like, some other business on the side. So at the beginning, I didn't I couldn't just go straight and work hundred percent watching the course and do, like, all the strategy.\n\nI had to, like, use some time to do it. So it took a little bit of time at the beginning. So I think November I don't really remember in November what I was doing, but I think I was watching the course while, kind of starting to build the v two. And, I started selling in December.\n\nThat's what from what I remember, I started I started selling with the funnel setup, etcetera, in December, and I started only with YouTube at the beginning, with the YouTube because I already had, like, a YouTube channel. And so I started just doing what Charlie was doing, at the end at the end of the video. I had my YouTube strategy, but I was just, like, using the way he he just, introduces offer at the end of the video, and I started having some, some calls. It was at the same time as Christmas holidays where I was skiing and in the evening, taking some calls.\n\nSo, yeah, that was how I launched the the the course at the beginning. So first month, I did, like, fifteen k, which is good. I was happy because I was, like, on holiday and, working on the course at the same time, building the course and skiing. So it was not easy.\n\nSecond month, January, was a great month for me, but it was the month number two. I was still working on building the course, because I I sold again before build.\n\nSo people that subscribed knew that I was about to release week after week.\n\nSo I was build keep so I built over two or three months the the the version two. And, yeah. So month number two was really, like, building the course, doing YouTube videos, doing calls, and hiring a setter to be able to start also doing setting on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nAnd I did thirty four k on months too, which is quite good for yourself.\n\nWithout any closes. Right?\n\nAlone while do while doing YouTube, video and especially building the course that was taking a lot of time.\n\nAnd and, what's your ticket, man? Is it two thousand euros? Was that right?\n\nThree. Two thousand nine hundred.\n\nOkay. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect.\n\nAnd so So in invoiced, when I'm when I'm saying thirty four, it's, like, invoiced because there are some payment plan as well.\n\nSo it's not, like, straight in the in the pocket, but it's payment plan.\n\nIt's revenue rather than the impact.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nMakes sense, man. And how many appointments do you think you you booked in that second month right there?\n\nActually, not that much because, I had a high closing rate for forty percent closing rate.\n\nI didn't book that much appointment, appointment.\n\nAt the beginning, I had a big problem with a no show that I, I found a technique on the easy grow group from Aurelien that I think he posted it like one year and a half ago. And that helped me reduce from sixty percent to twenty percent no show. Crazy. So at the beginning I was booking some call, but a lot of no shows. And, I don't know, like maybe I booked thirty calls, something like that. Mhmm. And also my agenda was I couldn't do only two or three call per day.\n\nSo my agenda was often booked fully booked.\n\nSo that's Yeah. Second month was was thirty four k.\n\nLike, in terms of the calendar, it was fully booked. Like, you didn't take any appointments because you couldn't. You're building the program and everything.\n\nSometime, it was not fully booked.\n\nI remember some weeks where I didn't have that much, appointment, because maybe because, like, the YouTube video was not doing so well or something like that. But I was really relying on only one strategy, which was which was kind of weak in a way.\n\nBut that still helped me doing that. And I think I, yeah, I I hired a setter.\n\nI hired a setter, I think, mid January. So he started, I started having some appointment booked also through the Instagram setter in January.\n\nMhmm. And through the Instagram, was that by the DMs or were you posting and people were replying and you were taking it from there?\n\nYes. I'm posting, some so I have, like, video, short videos that are live on my Instagram and TikTok every day for years.\n\nAnd I started posting, like, post where I was, like, promoting a video, a guide or like something.\n\nAnd, in the posting to the people, like, if they wanna receive this special gift, they can DM me buzzword like, airdrop or Bitcoin or whatever. And then I send them the the the the link of the video. And then the setter was doing a a a video, explaining like, saying, okay. We have a good opportunity to introduce you.\n\nDo you want us to show you the opportunity? And then they send after the guy on Instagram say, yeah. Okay. Why not?\n\nThen we send him a video explaining a little bit the offer. And if he's interested, then he can book a call.\n\nMhmm. And, if we build up from that, how was February, man? That's when you hired some closes. Right?\n\nYeah. No. January. January.\n\nJanuary is when you had closes, and then they came into effect properly in in February. Right?\n\nYeah. I think they started end of January. And but at the beginning, when you do the setting, the like, the booking come after because there is, like, a little time lapse between the moment they send the first message and the moment the the the the person will book the meeting.\n\nTalking about the closes on this side of things, man. Have you hired any enclosures to take the calls yet?\n\nOr am I Yeah. Now I have one closer Okay.\n\nAnd one setter.\n\nGot it. Got it. Got it. And are you still taking calls?\n\nNo. But I will stop doing it again because I was so what happened in February is that I had, like, a long term planned holiday. So I went I went to Asia and, the it was planned for, like, six months. So I knew I had like to hire a closer setter before to keep the business going on.\n\nMhmm.\n\nAnd I still made twenty k on in February while, being in Thailand and in Bali, which is cool.\n\nBut I was still working a little bit every day, like, yeah, going on my school group, doing some call with, the people in my in my course.\n\nBut that was yeah. I didn't do any video for three weeks on YouTube. And, still the video the video that we're still performing, we're still bringing appointment, which is quite cool.\n\nAnd, the setter was booking some appointment and the closer was closing it.\n\nAnd, how did it feel being on holiday and and and making money? You know, instead of seeing the bank account going down, you're seeing it going down.\n\nYeah. Yeah. It's great. It's great. Yeah. I was happy because, I was happy also because, at the beginning, the closer had, like, bad results.\n\nHe was closing with a ten percent rate on the first thirty calls. But also because I didn't take the time to really help him at the beginning, I I gave him the script and stuff, but the the thing is that he came from a school, like, a closing school. And so he also had his own theory. And then I just explained him, like, just, man, follow the script.\n\nTrust me. Follow the script. Do what I do. I do forty percent.\n\nI do I close with forty percent. You close with ten. Just follow what I say. And straight after, it's started closing at more than twenty percent, twenty, twenty five percent.\n\nWow.\n\nAnd, he's still improving, so it's cool. And I was really happy to to see that, actually.\n\nAnd what kind what are kind of the the next steps, you know, financially, the the next moves that you're gonna make essentially?\n\nSo you mean the the goal?\n\nMhmm.\n\nSo my goal my main goal, starting Easy Grow was hundred k per month, because I know I know I can do it with, like, the the size of the community I have, the quality of the service I have. I'm really happy about about that. So I knew I I was able to do it. And so now it's really like the the main objective. Just go to that objective, which is basically thirty three new customer per month Mhmm. Which is really doable, and I just need to book more appointment, actually.\n\nMhmm. Makes sense, man. So in terms of that, it's it's booking more appointments. You're gonna hire more closes potentially, or you think you'll just stick with one at the moment?\n\nSo once his Calendly will be fully booked, and so I will start doing closing call again soon, maybe one or two per day. And, yeah, of course, when he will be fully booked, I will hire another one for sure.\n\nThat's good, man. And, what would you say the hardest thing was was going through the course?\n\nThat's a good good question.\n\nYeah. I don't know. Maybe the hardest thing was to follow the first model that is long and, you just want to go implementing some strategy. And at the beginning, it's a lot of theory.\n\nBut it's real. It's also really helpful.\n\nThere was not really hard thing for me because I was really, really to implement everything fast. So I think the the hard thing was to just go fast because I wanted to, I I knew with the the the timing of the the the crypto market was pumping, I had to to be fast to start implementing things. So it's always a little bit, a little bit frustrating at the beginning because you always feel everything is going too slow.\n\nBut I mean, I know that as well, so, but yeah, what was really, what, what I really liked actually about the program, that's what I'm saying to my friend or, like, the people that are in business that I know and that use as a strategy, and that also works well because I'm pretty sure you can go to a goal with different kind of strategy. Everybody can have a different strategy. You just have to find the strategy that works best for you.\n\nWhat I really liked about easy grow is the scientific approach to business that I really don't have on my personal, like my personality and the way I do business. Mhmm. And I know, like, when I see Charlie explaining that you you feel that it's really in his bones.\n\nMhmm. And so that's really what helped me this really, like, track everything, find the bottleneck of the business and yeah, I still haven't, analyzed enough all the figures because I think I need a little bit more data, but it's really great to know that you track everything so that you can just know with the figures what's worked and what's doesn't work, actually.\n\nMhmm.\n\nI've got a funny one for you, man. I've been friends with Charlie for a long time, and I remember maybe about two years ago, he was at my apartment.\n\nAnd I go to make her some coffee, and and he's sitting in the sun on the balcony. And I come back out, and he's reading this physics book, like, with his thing. And I'm like, mom, what are you doing? You work in business. You're I'm not a physicist, and and and that's been him for the past five years. So I'm I'm I'm I'm really glad that you found that helpful.\n\nIt sounds like a cheesy question, but where would you be without the program, today?\n\nWhere would they be?\n\nRealistically. You know?\n\nWhere will they be what? Without the program, you mean?\n\nWithout the program. You know?\n\nSo I think I will be doing, webinars with a lot of ads Right. Probably.\n\nSo, yeah, I knew I wanted so back in time, when I was younger and launching my business, I really thought that I would be able to do everything by myself. And, actually, I discovered after being in business for more years and meeting more people that if you really want to scale your business and perform, you have to surround yourself with experts on different domain because you just can't be a master at everything.\n\nSo, yeah, When I decided to relaunch this v two, I knew I will relaunch it with, someone held by someone that is doing something similar and, is having really good results.\n\nAnd so, yeah, I had the easy grow option that I was considering. And I had another option with, like, a French guy that is expert in, webinars. And, like, his clients are making a lot of money as well. But it's just, it's just a different strategy.\n\nAnd I also enjoyed the the easy growth strategy because I think that's, what's cool with easy growth is that when when you start building your acquisition strategy with e zero, you build with different it's like having a house with different pillar, you know. And if you have one pillar going down, you don't have the whole business going down. When you rely on when you have, like, a business, you have to think also, like, in term of, long time and and and setting up a strategy that is working and secured as well. Yeah.\n\nAnd so I I like that. I like the fact that you are building with different, yet, different channel, different strategy, different acquisition strategy. And then you really don't have, like, only one big, even if the ads are not working anymore, then you still have your organic, your newsletter, your YouTube channel, your Instagram setter, your whatever Loom system. You know?\n\nExactly, man. It is that security. It is that stability. Right?\n\nIt's just I knew this would happen. Right? That it would be funny kind of thinking back to our sales call because it took an hour and a half, two hours to close because because you were hesitant there. I could see her, you know, as as clear as day. But what would you say somebody that that's in that position maybe right now where they're like, yes, but no, but yes, but no, and in and out and in, and they're really, really, really struggling with that decision.\n\nWhat would you say, Nana?\n\nSo, yeah, what I would say so actually I had, someone contacted me on Instagram three days ago that was like, yeah, I saw your trust pad at review. What do you really think about Easy Grow? And I was like, yeah, go for it, bro.\n\nSo, yeah, I think, it's really good pro it's really an amazing program.\n\nI've been through a different program.\n\nIt's a really good program, because it's really it's working. It's a lot of work as well. It's not for, like, you have to the only thing I would say to someone that wanna join Easy Grow is, like, are you really motivated to do business? You really wanna do business?\n\nDo you do you really wanna scale a business? Because it's, it's a lot of work. If yes, you can follow EasyGrow. It's a really great program.\n\nYou will find your way because in six months, I will not have time to follow the whole course, man. It's it's it's a lot. So it's good for SMMA guy. It's good for coach.\n\nIt's good for guy like me that have a bigger following.\n\nSo, yeah, I think I think it's, it's a really great program and, it's really helpful. But, yeah, you have to work. You have to implement everything and, and, it's not a magic pill. It's a magic pill in a way, but but you still have to do your your your part of the job for sure.\n\nBut it's great to be with, with guys that, yeah, really are performing like crazy. I think now you are doing, like, one million per month. I saw a video of Charlie recently. Mhmm.\n\nAnd I remember what month is this? We are in March. I remember seeing a video of Charlie back in August, where he was saying he was doing three hundred k. So that means you've been from three hundred k in August to a million in March.\n\nA a little bit different, man. It was three hundred k last March. So we have doubled the business in in the year essentially. But still, it's insane.\n\nI've got three minutes before I've gotta jump on another call and, continue the good work, but I wanna ask you one last thing, man. In terms of obviously, you work in the French speaking market and and and the strategies, you know, being in English and so on and so forth. Did you have any difficulties with that? Did it translate perfectly?\n\nDid everything work as stated? Or what did that look like in terms of, like, the language difference?\n\nYeah. So I have no problem with English. So for me, it's it's no problem. The only thing is I have to find member of my team that know English, well.\n\nSo, yeah, my close when when I was hiring a closer, I really was asking, like, do you understand English? Can you speak English if you join a sales call with the coach? Can you explain it? So I think it's, it's just a challenge for for that. But, yeah, one thing I think that is different, between both market, English market and French market, I think in English the English market is more saturated than the French market.\n\nSo, I think I think I told you this on the call.\n\nRight?\n\nYeah. And there is still a lot of people making a lot of money and doing great business with all the strategy on the French market that are maybe not working anymore on the English speaking market.\n\nBut yeah, it's, it's it's what is cool is that, I've not seen anyone so far doing the same strategy as I do, because I'm in easy growing. I think there is not so many French in easy growing.\n\nMhmm.\n\nFantastic. That's cool. Cool. I'm not saying fantastic. There's not many French. I'm just saying it all over. Fantastic.\n\nAnd it it it has really been a pleasure.\n\nI'm gonna look forward to seeing you at a hundred thousand a month in in really no time at all because you've laid the foundation, and now it's just about scaling. Now it's simple. You got direction. Have fun building out more systems.\n\nAnd then if you ever need any additional help in sales, like, if you have more questions like earlier, let's jump on, and I might have some questions about crypto for you as well. I can never exchange one.\n\nThat's why I asked earlier if your course was, in, in French, man. Otherwise, you'd have another client.\n\nBut Yeah, man. You should have invested in crypto when we had the call. You were like, yeah. I don't want to invest in crypto because it takes my focus out.\n\nLike, in time, it was really the bottom, and now it's like I think I would have three x my money, right, since, since August.\n\nYeah. At least.\n\nI can just make more sales, man. That's fine. Yeah.\n\nAt least keep at least keep focusing on what you do because, otherwise, yeah.\n\nExactly, man. Dude, it's been a pleasure. We'll do another one when you're a hundred k in in two, three, four months from now. Okay?\n\nHopefully.\n\nWe can, man. Keep working, and Thanks.\n\nSee you in the community.\n\nThanks.\n\nSee you, Vince. Bye bye.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/kwx928b5dq?autoplay=0&wmode=transparent&wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

Perfect.\n\nOh, so anyone and everyone that's watching this, this is Tibalt. Is it Tibalt or Thibault?\n\nThibault.\n\nThibault. Okay. There we go. First time.\n\nYou think I know it by now after all these months.\n\nBut, yeah, man, I want you to introduce yourself, what you do, what you sell, who you sell to, just a little bit of context before we jump into everything.\n\nSure.\n\nSo, I'm, Thibault. I'm thirty, and, I'm in the crypto investment for a while now. For seven years, I started investing in twenty sixteen while I was still working in a big company, back in time.\n\nThen I started doing some, entrepreneur stuff online. So I did different things, things that were working, things that didn't work, things that worked that I stopped because I didn't like, or stuff like that, you know.\n\nAnd then I started creating content. So back in twenty twenty, there was, like, the beginning of the last bull market, in crypto, and I started, like, advising my friend about crypto because they they knew I I knew. And so one of my friend made a lot of money back in back in time. He had, like, two million to invest, and he called me.\n\nHe was like, okay, Thibault. If I wanna invest, like, twenty percent of that capital in crypto, what should I do? And that guy was, like, a huge YouTuber in China. He was, like, one of the biggest YouTuber in China.\n\nThat's how he made his money. He's French, by the way, but speak Chinese perfectly.\n\nAnd, while I was on the phone with him, he was like, man, you should really do videos about crypto because you know the the subject. There are not so many people online. So, yeah, why don't you do video about crypto? And that's how I started. And now I have, like, more than six hundred thousand followers on different social network.\n\nTikTok, I started with short content. I started with TikTok when it was a small thing. That's how my account exploded. So I have, like, five hundred forty thousand on TikTok. I have, like, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, a newsletter.\n\nAnd, I'm selling a course and coaching about crypto, like crypto investment and airdrops, how to position yourself before everybody know a crypto, how to hedge your risk, how to invest with a proper strategy and exit the market before everybody everything goes wrong. You know? Mhmm.\n\nAnd then if if if I'm right to remember, it's exclusively in French in the French market. Right?\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. French speaking.\n\nYeah. So you joined us around, like, three, four months ago. Like, where were you at, before you joined? You had, like, version one of the program.\n\nI'm struggling to remember, you know, the exact details of where you were at.\n\nYeah. So I had the v one of the program that I launched in twenty twenty one.\n\nAnd then, I wanted to work on the v two.\n\nThen I wanted to launch a v two, and the v one I did and launch it with a webinar strategy back in time, like the Russell Brunson strategy webinar, and no ads, just organic. I did some videos, bring a lot of people in the webinar, and, started my course with, like, sell before build. So I sold the course, and then I built it.\n\nAnd people were happy about it.\n\nAnd then I stopped. That was my biggest mistake. I stopped sending it for some reason. I don't know why, actually. I wanted to I had, like, a shiny object syndrome. I wanted to do an agency helping, like, Web three founder do, like, marketing.\n\nAnd then I realized that, it's not so shiny to do that kind of business. In my opinion, it was not what I liked the most. And so then, after doing after realizing that I was subject to the shiny oblique syndrome for two years, I was still doing some business, working with some brands, doing some partnership and stuff. I really wanted to refocus on the course, which was, like, the thing I really enjoy doing.\n\nAnd so I refocused on the course. And when I booked that call with you, I was already following, Easy Growth Strategy and Charlie Morgan, YouTube channel for, like, a few months.\n\nAnd, yeah, that's that's why I booked actually because I wanted to I wanted a clear path. I knew I I know a lot of people doing business, online, and everybody has a different strategy.\n\nAnd, when you have your strategy and then someone else come with, like, you're showing you amazing result with another strategy, you attempted to move that strategy. And I really wanted to have, like, a clear path a clear path from some people that are making a lot of money and having good results and just follow the path. And that's also why I booked the the call with you, actually.\n\nMhmm. And, since we're talking about the call, I'm like, man, it was a long call. Right? It was an hour and a an hour and a half.\n\nTwo hours, I think, even.\n\nTwo hours? Wow.\n\nMaybe maybe less. Maybe less. Yeah. But, yeah, it was an on call.\n\nI haven't I haven't figured out my camera here. I can't figure out how to get it to auto adjust just yet.\n\nSo I have to manually switch when the sun comes out. Anyway, it was a it was a long call, and you had your objections. So, you know, having watched Charlie and knowing that you wanted that kind of process, what do you think was holding you back at the time right there?\n\nWhat was holding me back was, that I knew another guy that was doing also, like, a course mastermind stuff that I I know is working well, but it's a total different strategy. It's more based on webinar and ads, which is more like a Russell Brunson style. You do webinar every week, and you power that webinar with a lot of ads. Mhmm. And so, yeah, that was the I had to make I had to make a choice between between the two. And, yeah, that's why I think I was thinking that much during the call.\n\nMakes sense, man. Glad we got you in. Right? I think it's, like, a kind of contrast.\n\nWhat are you doing now in terms of revenue, in terms of numbers of the business?\n\nYeah. So I subscribed end of October, then in, I think, in November. So I I still had, like, some other business on the side. So at the beginning, I didn't I couldn't just go straight and work hundred percent watching the course and do, like, all the strategy.\n\nI had to, like, use some time to do it. So it took a little bit of time at the beginning. So I think November I don't really remember in November what I was doing, but I think I was watching the course while, kind of starting to build the v two. And, I started selling in December.\n\nThat's what from what I remember, I started I started selling with the funnel setup, etcetera, in December, and I started only with YouTube at the beginning, with the YouTube because I already had, like, a YouTube channel. And so I started just doing what Charlie was doing, at the end at the end of the video. I had my YouTube strategy, but I was just, like, using the way he he just, introduces offer at the end of the video, and I started having some, some calls. It was at the same time as Christmas holidays where I was skiing and in the evening, taking some calls.\n\nSo, yeah, that was how I launched the the the course at the beginning. So first month, I did, like, fifteen k, which is good. I was happy because I was, like, on holiday and, working on the course at the same time, building the course and skiing. So it was not easy.\n\nSecond month, January, was a great month for me, but it was the month number two. I was still working on building the course, because I I sold again before build.\n\nSo people that subscribed knew that I was about to release week after week.\n\nSo I was build keep so I built over two or three months the the the version two. And, yeah. So month number two was really, like, building the course, doing YouTube videos, doing calls, and hiring a setter to be able to start also doing setting on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nAnd I did thirty four k on months too, which is quite good for yourself.\n\nWithout any closes. Right?\n\nAlone while do while doing YouTube, video and especially building the course that was taking a lot of time.\n\nAnd and, what's your ticket, man? Is it two thousand euros? Was that right?\n\nThree. Two thousand nine hundred.\n\nOkay. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect.\n\nAnd so So in invoiced, when I'm when I'm saying thirty four, it's, like, invoiced because there are some payment plan as well.\n\nSo it's not, like, straight in the in the pocket, but it's payment plan.\n\nIt's revenue rather than the impact.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nMakes sense, man. And how many appointments do you think you you booked in that second month right there?\n\nActually, not that much because, I had a high closing rate for forty percent closing rate.\n\nI didn't book that much appointment, appointment.\n\nAt the beginning, I had a big problem with a no show that I, I found a technique on the easy grow group from Aurelien that I think he posted it like one year and a half ago. And that helped me reduce from sixty percent to twenty percent no show. Crazy. So at the beginning I was booking some call, but a lot of no shows. And, I don't know, like maybe I booked thirty calls, something like that. Mhmm. And also my agenda was I couldn't do only two or three call per day.\n\nSo my agenda was often booked fully booked.\n\nSo that's Yeah. Second month was was thirty four k.\n\nLike, in terms of the calendar, it was fully booked. Like, you didn't take any appointments because you couldn't. You're building the program and everything.\n\nSometime, it was not fully booked.\n\nI remember some weeks where I didn't have that much, appointment, because maybe because, like, the YouTube video was not doing so well or something like that. But I was really relying on only one strategy, which was which was kind of weak in a way.\n\nBut that still helped me doing that. And I think I, yeah, I I hired a setter.\n\nI hired a setter, I think, mid January. So he started, I started having some appointment booked also through the Instagram setter in January.\n\nMhmm. And through the Instagram, was that by the DMs or were you posting and people were replying and you were taking it from there?\n\nYes. I'm posting, some so I have, like, video, short videos that are live on my Instagram and TikTok every day for years.\n\nAnd I started posting, like, post where I was, like, promoting a video, a guide or like something.\n\nAnd, in the posting to the people, like, if they wanna receive this special gift, they can DM me buzzword like, airdrop or Bitcoin or whatever. And then I send them the the the the link of the video. And then the setter was doing a a a video, explaining like, saying, okay. We have a good opportunity to introduce you.\n\nDo you want us to show you the opportunity? And then they send after the guy on Instagram say, yeah. Okay. Why not?\n\nThen we send him a video explaining a little bit the offer. And if he's interested, then he can book a call.\n\nMhmm. And, if we build up from that, how was February, man? That's when you hired some closes. Right?\n\nYeah. No. January. January.\n\nJanuary is when you had closes, and then they came into effect properly in in February. Right?\n\nYeah. I think they started end of January. And but at the beginning, when you do the setting, the like, the booking come after because there is, like, a little time lapse between the moment they send the first message and the moment the the the the person will book the meeting.\n\nTalking about the closes on this side of things, man. Have you hired any enclosures to take the calls yet?\n\nOr am I Yeah. Now I have one closer Okay.\n\nAnd one setter.\n\nGot it. Got it. Got it. And are you still taking calls?\n\nNo. But I will stop doing it again because I was so what happened in February is that I had, like, a long term planned holiday. So I went I went to Asia and, the it was planned for, like, six months. So I knew I had like to hire a closer setter before to keep the business going on.\n\nMhmm.\n\nAnd I still made twenty k on in February while, being in Thailand and in Bali, which is cool.\n\nBut I was still working a little bit every day, like, yeah, going on my school group, doing some call with, the people in my in my course.\n\nBut that was yeah. I didn't do any video for three weeks on YouTube. And, still the video the video that we're still performing, we're still bringing appointment, which is quite cool.\n\nAnd, the setter was booking some appointment and the closer was closing it.\n\nAnd, how did it feel being on holiday and and and making money? You know, instead of seeing the bank account going down, you're seeing it going down.\n\nYeah. Yeah. It's great. It's great. Yeah. I was happy because, I was happy also because, at the beginning, the closer had, like, bad results.\n\nHe was closing with a ten percent rate on the first thirty calls. But also because I didn't take the time to really help him at the beginning, I I gave him the script and stuff, but the the thing is that he came from a school, like, a closing school. And so he also had his own theory. And then I just explained him, like, just, man, follow the script.\n\nTrust me. Follow the script. Do what I do. I do forty percent.\n\nI do I close with forty percent. You close with ten. Just follow what I say. And straight after, it's started closing at more than twenty percent, twenty, twenty five percent.\n\nWow.\n\nAnd, he's still improving, so it's cool. And I was really happy to to see that, actually.\n\nAnd what kind what are kind of the the next steps, you know, financially, the the next moves that you're gonna make essentially?\n\nSo you mean the the goal?\n\nMhmm.\n\nSo my goal my main goal, starting Easy Grow was hundred k per month, because I know I know I can do it with, like, the the size of the community I have, the quality of the service I have. I'm really happy about about that. So I knew I I was able to do it. And so now it's really like the the main objective. Just go to that objective, which is basically thirty three new customer per month Mhmm. Which is really doable, and I just need to book more appointment, actually.\n\nMhmm. Makes sense, man. So in terms of that, it's it's booking more appointments. You're gonna hire more closes potentially, or you think you'll just stick with one at the moment?\n\nSo once his Calendly will be fully booked, and so I will start doing closing call again soon, maybe one or two per day. And, yeah, of course, when he will be fully booked, I will hire another one for sure.\n\nThat's good, man. And, what would you say the hardest thing was was going through the course?\n\nThat's a good good question.\n\nYeah. I don't know. Maybe the hardest thing was to follow the first model that is long and, you just want to go implementing some strategy. And at the beginning, it's a lot of theory.\n\nBut it's real. It's also really helpful.\n\nThere was not really hard thing for me because I was really, really to implement everything fast. So I think the the hard thing was to just go fast because I wanted to, I I knew with the the the timing of the the the crypto market was pumping, I had to to be fast to start implementing things. So it's always a little bit, a little bit frustrating at the beginning because you always feel everything is going too slow.\n\nBut I mean, I know that as well, so, but yeah, what was really, what, what I really liked actually about the program, that's what I'm saying to my friend or, like, the people that are in business that I know and that use as a strategy, and that also works well because I'm pretty sure you can go to a goal with different kind of strategy. Everybody can have a different strategy. You just have to find the strategy that works best for you.\n\nWhat I really liked about easy grow is the scientific approach to business that I really don't have on my personal, like my personality and the way I do business. Mhmm. And I know, like, when I see Charlie explaining that you you feel that it's really in his bones.\n\nMhmm. And so that's really what helped me this really, like, track everything, find the bottleneck of the business and yeah, I still haven't, analyzed enough all the figures because I think I need a little bit more data, but it's really great to know that you track everything so that you can just know with the figures what's worked and what's doesn't work, actually.\n\nMhmm.\n\nI've got a funny one for you, man. I've been friends with Charlie for a long time, and I remember maybe about two years ago, he was at my apartment.\n\nAnd I go to make her some coffee, and and he's sitting in the sun on the balcony. And I come back out, and he's reading this physics book, like, with his thing. And I'm like, mom, what are you doing? You work in business. You're I'm not a physicist, and and and that's been him for the past five years. So I'm I'm I'm I'm really glad that you found that helpful.\n\nIt sounds like a cheesy question, but where would you be without the program, today?\n\nWhere would they be?\n\nRealistically. You know?\n\nWhere will they be what? Without the program, you mean?\n\nWithout the program. You know?\n\nSo I think I will be doing, webinars with a lot of ads Right. Probably.\n\nSo, yeah, I knew I wanted so back in time, when I was younger and launching my business, I really thought that I would be able to do everything by myself. And, actually, I discovered after being in business for more years and meeting more people that if you really want to scale your business and perform, you have to surround yourself with experts on different domain because you just can't be a master at everything.\n\nSo, yeah, When I decided to relaunch this v two, I knew I will relaunch it with, someone held by someone that is doing something similar and, is having really good results.\n\nAnd so, yeah, I had the easy grow option that I was considering. And I had another option with, like, a French guy that is expert in, webinars. And, like, his clients are making a lot of money as well. But it's just, it's just a different strategy.\n\nAnd I also enjoyed the the easy growth strategy because I think that's, what's cool with easy growth is that when when you start building your acquisition strategy with e zero, you build with different it's like having a house with different pillar, you know. And if you have one pillar going down, you don't have the whole business going down. When you rely on when you have, like, a business, you have to think also, like, in term of, long time and and and setting up a strategy that is working and secured as well. Yeah.\n\nAnd so I I like that. I like the fact that you are building with different, yet, different channel, different strategy, different acquisition strategy. And then you really don't have, like, only one big, even if the ads are not working anymore, then you still have your organic, your newsletter, your YouTube channel, your Instagram setter, your whatever Loom system. You know?\n\nExactly, man. It is that security. It is that stability. Right?\n\nIt's just I knew this would happen. Right? That it would be funny kind of thinking back to our sales call because it took an hour and a half, two hours to close because because you were hesitant there. I could see her, you know, as as clear as day. But what would you say somebody that that's in that position maybe right now where they're like, yes, but no, but yes, but no, and in and out and in, and they're really, really, really struggling with that decision.\n\nWhat would you say, Nana?\n\nSo, yeah, what I would say so actually I had, someone contacted me on Instagram three days ago that was like, yeah, I saw your trust pad at review. What do you really think about Easy Grow? And I was like, yeah, go for it, bro.\n\nSo, yeah, I think, it's really good pro it's really an amazing program.\n\nI've been through a different program.\n\nIt's a really good program, because it's really it's working. It's a lot of work as well. It's not for, like, you have to the only thing I would say to someone that wanna join Easy Grow is, like, are you really motivated to do business? You really wanna do business?\n\nDo you do you really wanna scale a business? Because it's, it's a lot of work. If yes, you can follow EasyGrow. It's a really great program.\n\nYou will find your way because in six months, I will not have time to follow the whole course, man. It's it's it's a lot. So it's good for SMMA guy. It's good for coach.\n\nIt's good for guy like me that have a bigger following.\n\nSo, yeah, I think I think it's, it's a really great program and, it's really helpful. But, yeah, you have to work. You have to implement everything and, and, it's not a magic pill. It's a magic pill in a way, but but you still have to do your your your part of the job for sure.\n\nBut it's great to be with, with guys that, yeah, really are performing like crazy. I think now you are doing, like, one million per month. I saw a video of Charlie recently. Mhmm.\n\nAnd I remember what month is this? We are in March. I remember seeing a video of Charlie back in August, where he was saying he was doing three hundred k. So that means you've been from three hundred k in August to a million in March.\n\nA a little bit different, man. It was three hundred k last March. So we have doubled the business in in the year essentially. But still, it's insane.\n\nI've got three minutes before I've gotta jump on another call and, continue the good work, but I wanna ask you one last thing, man. In terms of obviously, you work in the French speaking market and and and the strategies, you know, being in English and so on and so forth. Did you have any difficulties with that? Did it translate perfectly?\n\nDid everything work as stated? Or what did that look like in terms of, like, the language difference?\n\nYeah. So I have no problem with English. So for me, it's it's no problem. The only thing is I have to find member of my team that know English, well.\n\nSo, yeah, my close when when I was hiring a closer, I really was asking, like, do you understand English? Can you speak English if you join a sales call with the coach? Can you explain it? So I think it's, it's just a challenge for for that. But, yeah, one thing I think that is different, between both market, English market and French market, I think in English the English market is more saturated than the French market.\n\nSo, I think I think I told you this on the call.\n\nRight?\n\nYeah. And there is still a lot of people making a lot of money and doing great business with all the strategy on the French market that are maybe not working anymore on the English speaking market.\n\nBut yeah, it's, it's it's what is cool is that, I've not seen anyone so far doing the same strategy as I do, because I'm in easy growing. I think there is not so many French in easy growing.\n\nMhmm.\n\nFantastic. That's cool. Cool. I'm not saying fantastic. There's not many French. I'm just saying it all over. Fantastic.\n\nAnd it it it has really been a pleasure.\n\nI'm gonna look forward to seeing you at a hundred thousand a month in in really no time at all because you've laid the foundation, and now it's just about scaling. Now it's simple. You got direction. Have fun building out more systems.\n\nAnd then if you ever need any additional help in sales, like, if you have more questions like earlier, let's jump on, and I might have some questions about crypto for you as well. I can never exchange one.\n\nThat's why I asked earlier if your course was, in, in French, man. Otherwise, you'd have another client.\n\nBut Yeah, man. You should have invested in crypto when we had the call. You were like, yeah. I don't want to invest in crypto because it takes my focus out.\n\nLike, in time, it was really the bottom, and now it's like I think I would have three x my money, right, since, since August.\n\nYeah. At least.\n\nI can just make more sales, man. That's fine. Yeah.\n\nAt least keep at least keep focusing on what you do because, otherwise, yeah.\n\nExactly, man. Dude, it's been a pleasure. We'll do another one when you're a hundred k in in two, three, four months from now. Okay?\n\nHopefully.\n\nWe can, man. Keep working, and Thanks.\n\nSee you in the community.\n\nThanks.\n\nSee you, Vince. Bye bye."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}}, {});
