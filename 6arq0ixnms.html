It's client interview time. Today I'm interviewing Luke, one of my clients. He joined us when we launched EZ Grow three months, that's three, three months ago.\n\nI thought I couldn't count for a second ago. Luke's got a pretty interesting story. He went from about ten k a month to sixty k a month over the course of three months. So throughout the interview, I'm gonna explore basically how he added fifty thousand dollars in new monthly revenue to his agency.\n\nI made a slight slip up throughout the interview where I referred to his growth going from ten to fifty k a month. He actually later corrected me saying he went from ten to sixty k a month. So I thought he had a forty grand in new monthly revenue. He actually had a fifty, so it's like six hundred k in your yearly revenue off the back of just one investment in Easy Grow, which I think he means got a pretty bloody good ROI, I'm pretty sure.\n\nBut either way, I wanna welcome you to the interview. Throughout this interview, I'm gonna be asking Luke questions about how he used the program, what systems he used. He's also gonna drop some knowledge on how he's built his agency and how he now has changed his mindset to do so. I'm really excited for this one.\n\nAnd, without further ado, let's take it away. Also, he shows his calendar. It's very exciting. Let's do it.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, welcome to another client interview for the channel. Today, I have the wonderful Luke, friend of mine, client of mine who's been working with us for it's been three months, I think, Luke. About three.\n\nYeah. Right around three months of February.\n\nThree months. Now this is a bit of a special one because on these client interviews, you know, typically, we're looking at adding, like, ten, twenty k in monthly revenue, which is pretty awesome to do that in three months or so. But Luke kind of thought, screw that. I'm gonna go a little bit above and beyond.\n\nAnd he went from ten k a month to fifty k a month. Basically, the forty thousand dollars in your monthly revenue or, you know, roughly five hundred k a month per year. Sorry. Not a month.\n\nThat'd be cool. Per year in revenue to his agency. And in this video, we're gonna talk about how Easy Grow helped him achieve that. For transparency, the purpose of this video is obviously to encourage you to schedule a call and buy from me.\n\nJust want that to be a help there because Luke knows how I operate. You know, this is obviously a sales sort of thing. But, also, I think it might give you some idea as to how to do that yourself. So, Luke, why don't you take a second just to introduce yourself, a bit about the agency, who you serve.\n\nAnd also, guys, Luke is gonna show you what his calendar looked like before and after the program, which is also which is pretty good. So take it away, man.\n\nYeah. One hundred percent. So, yeah, my name is Luke Soleila. I own luck agency.\n\nSo, yeah, we originally started around ten k. And after working with Charlie, we're now around eighteen to twenty clients, depending on just deposits. So that'll put us right around fifty k a month in added revenue, since when we started. And, yeah, the way we operate is a little bit different in the real estate niche, I guess you could say.\n\nWe charge pay upfront retainer. So we're right around about twenty five hundred to start. And then, yeah, we just work off of guarantee, obviously, all that good stuff, but that's kind of a little backing on how we operate. We work with real estate agents.\n\nSo run Facebook ads for them, book appointments, all that good stuff.\n\nSo So talking of appointments, let's see a calendar. So Luke showed me this. Yeah. Before we started the interview, he said, here's my calendar in, like, February.\n\nAnd you can see it.\n\nThis is January, February.\n\nYeah. So this was January. Really had no idea what I was doing. We're booking about probably ten to fifteen appointments the whole pretty much the whole month, unfortunately. And then same thing in February.\n\nJumped in in February, started working with Charlie. And then this is what March looks like. Getting a little better here, booking about trying to book around thirty a week, but weren't quite there. And that April really, really cleaned up to an extent.\n\nWe're locating probably about five to eight calls a day, give or take. And then, yeah, May, same exact thing. Last week, we had a little bit of a slow week, but we just picked up again this week. We're already booked it up next week.\n\nAnd just to let everyone know, Luke, am I paying you to say this?\n\nWe're not. Nope. Not not not at all.\n\nSo that's, we we haven't seen the calendars before, but, we'll talk about this. Because Luke's used a couple of systems from Easy Grow to basically achieve this, most notably the outbound systems. I think just just two of the fifteen we've got or something.\n\nSo Luke, let's let's start with the, the genesis of this journey. So, you mentioned before the interview, you'd been burned before. You bought a high ticket mentorship. Obviously, that comes with a lot of trust issues. Why don't you talk to people about how you were before you joined the program, where you're at in the agency, the struggles, everything, and we'll we'll sort of build up from there.\n\nYeah. Hundred percent.\n\nSo full transparency, I had a I had ten k a month on, like, a pretty big pedestal. So when I hit it, I hit it pretty quickly. So the thing with that is I immediately let off the gas because I thought, okay. So all the all the gurus, everybody on YouTube is like, you gotta hit ten k a month.\n\nAnd then it hit ten k a month, and it was probably the worst thing that ever happened to me, which sounds crazy, which is the opposite of what everyone else says. But the issue is as soon as I hit that ten k a month, my systems were really inconsistent leading up to it. So I was booking, like, we're I was showing you guys probably ten to fifteen appointments a month, cold calling maybe one or two times a week, and then sending probably a hundred, two hundred emails a week. Now kind of fast forward, we're booking, obviously, like, thirty calls a month or thirty calls a week.\n\nAnd the biggest thing there is just the consistency changed. So I had a moment that was a very, like a reality check, like I was telling Charlie. And the past program, that I took, they put no emphasis on service delivery.\n\nSo that was one of those things where I really didn't have a lot of help in booking, new appointments, and then I had no help with retaining clients. So when I I looked for, I guess, a better mentor, a better path, I saw Charlie was very heavy on service, was very heavy on, obviously, booking appointments. So that's kinda where that decision came from. And especially with the past experience I had, I was very hesitant at the beginning, and then just more client interviews like the one we're doing now.\n\nYeah. They were one of those, man.\n\nYeah. Was one of the best ones.\n\nAnd then, yeah, that that was just one of those things where I was like, you know what? I will take a chance.\n\nAnd then just a lot of it was accountability, especially from everybody in the course, or program, and then, also the cost and all of that. And, yeah, I think that was really the, I guess, you could say, pivotal point, in terms of where we're at now.\n\nShout out to Seb, sales rep. Wonderful guy. Okay. So you'd seen some client interviews. You'd you've been burned before. You got to that point where ten k a month, either you you achieved some comfort or basically you just, like, it's it's inconsistent.\n\nSo you seem like a very I can imagine, because I didn't speak to you before, but I can imagine you're a very different person now. Do you wanna touch briefly on the mindset shifts and the paradigm shifts that happened as a result of the content and going to the program?\n\nA hundred percent. So I think that is actually the most important part of the whole entire program because I didn't realize I was kind of I don't wanna say I was not a hundred percent bought in on the whole mindset, until I really got into it because I used to always hear mindset is everything, and I was kinda like, yeah. I know you got to put everything.\n\nTotally not.\n\nLike Yeah.\n\nYeah. You can't do the whole thing. And that was truly a hundred percent transparency. That was the part that was really missing because the issue before is I was doing things, and I didn't know why I was doing them. So I would do, like, an eight hour day, in the office, and four hours of those were spent on YouTube watching, like, guru videos on how to do certain things.\n\nAnd I was like Sorry about that.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd at at at the time, I was like, okay. I'm actually doing something unproductive. And then I look at my calendar. I'm like, okay.\n\nI have no appointments booked. I have no pretty much revenue coming in. I barely hit ten k a month. And then, after going through the mindset training, self transcendence, all that good stuff, Mhmm.\n\nReally, the biggest thing I learned, which I think is priceless, personally, is just self awareness. So now I know okay. Like, I'm extremely like, there's certain times throughout the day. I know everybody has them where I'm like, okay.\n\nMaybe I could just take an hour here and watch this video.\n\nGame of Thrones can't hurt anyone. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd then now I realize, okay. That compounds. So if I spend ten minutes here, and then I spend another twenty minutes here, and I spend another hour here, before I know it, third of my day or a quarter of my day is spent watching YouTube when I could be doing outbound.\n\nDude, I think you just call out basically everyone watching this. Like Yeah. Oh, exactly. YouTube, guys. Stop masturbating to success and just start doing some work. So so now you're doing fifty k fifty k a month. You added forty grand in monthly revenue.\n\nTell me how I mean, I can't I don't know about you. The lifestyle change between ten grand a month and fifty grand a month might not be that significant. But would you mind touching on, like, how that has impacted you, like, how you feel? I mean, that'd be I'm sure that you truly feel pretty good.\n\nYeah. Yeah. The biggest thing I would say overall is just the kind of the mindset of going into it is now it went from very inconsistent, like, okay. I'm afraid of losing clients.\n\nI don't know if I'm gonna be able to get another client to now I'm in a position where, really worth a lot of it was a self transcendence and just know okay. I'm self aware now. If I know I need to be putting in more time, let's say, Monday or Tuesday to make sure I have appointments booked Thursday and Friday, I know I'm capable of that. So a lot more comfortable not comfortable, but I would say a lot more confident or more convicted, just in the product, the service, all that good stuff, and then really just my ability to, produce and book those appointments so I can get new clients and all that.\n\nLove it, man. So you talked about appointment booking.\n\nAre you still doing the appointment booking, or have you got people in place, SOPs and stuff from the program?\n\nYes. So one of the biggest things that I actually learned from the mindset training was ego. So I had a very, very large ego, I'll be transparent, leading up to this.\n\nAny anyone that says they had a large ego doesn't have a large ego anymore because they recognize it. Carry on.\n\nYep. A hundred percent. And that was really what was holding me back. I had a mindset that I'm I don't wanna say I'm too good, but I at the at the time, I thought I was too good to cold call. I thought I was too good to get rejected on the phone, all that kind of stuff. And, like, you were talking about going through the pain in the fire, that was what made the biggest difference. It's just me getting on the phone calling.\n\nAnd, yeah, at the beginning, before when I was calling, it was terrible. And then after I started learning proper scripts, all the types of stuff you were teaching, it made a huge difference because then it went from, I'm just getting rejected all day long to, oh my gosh. I'm actually booking appointments. Yeah. So Big difference there. Yeah.\n\nIt's kinda worth it. So the so you're doing the sales calls. So are you still doing cold calls yourself, or do you have people to do it for you now?\n\nYeah. Yeah. I still do everything. So I personally want to cold call all the way up to a hundred k a month, potentially two hundred k a month just because I think that's, like, the most humbling experience.\n\nMhmm. And right around forty percent of our well, yeah, forty percent of the closed clients we have now have come from cold calls. Mhmm.\n\nSo I think a big thing there is just, like, an extra personal connection that I wouldn't normally get with a cold email, if that makes sense.\n\nMakes sense. Well, what about the other sixty percent? Where have they come from?\n\nCold email.\n\nSo From the looms?\n\nOr no.\n\nSo I did a hybrid of the loom and, just like a cold email copy with the offer and all that. And then, yeah, that was kind of how it started, and then we've just been building it up over time. And now we're going kind of a more mass approach right around three to four hundred emails a day. Cool. Yeah, that's made a big difference.\n\nDude, thirty appointments a week. You can't argue with that, man. Do you take all the sales calls yourself?\n\nI do. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nYou don't stop, man. I love it. I bloody love it. So fifty k a month at the moment, what is next for for luck agency? What do you wanna do next?\n\nGreat question. So right now, I've been reinvesting most of the money just back into the product, because I think that's a big thing that's been missing. At least with all the other, people that I've seen on the Internet, you were one of the main ones who actually talked about product. And I think that's the most important part, product service, all that, because the worst feeling I ever had was losing those clients at the beginning.\n\nSo and that was one of those things where I think everybody's just so worried about selling, selling, selling. But when you lose fifty percent or seventy five percent of your business because you have a bad product, it ruins the whole experience. So that was one of those things where I've been, religiously just trying to figure out a way to build a better IT team, build better ads, build better systems in place. That was one of those things where I took a lot of cues and hints and a lot of information from you guys' follow-up processes and all that.\n\nIt's interesting, man, because, well, it's there's two points there. First, what you just said, when, like, we teach acquisition. Right?\n\nAnd what people don't realize is you can take the lessons that we teach in acquisition and imply that to your service delivery. Like, people think service delivery and client acquisition will be two different things. But, realistically, if you're doing marketing, service delivery is client acquisition from the business, so you can apply it.\n\nWhat else was I gonna say? I was gonna say something else that was quite important, but it's, like, just completely skipped my mind.\n\nNo. That's it. So through the program because you talked a lot about the mindset training.\n\nHow much of the mindset stuff what what do you think the percentage difference is in in terms of the result? Like, Would you attribute the mindset training to, like, seventy five percent of the results? Because this is the thing, like, guys, if you're watching this and you wanna buy Easybro, I need you to do the mindset training.\n\nSo I need I wanna, like, get everyone to do it because it's, like, completely life changing.\n\nBut yeah.\n\nYeah. I look at kind of now I look at everything in more of, like, a systemized approach, which I learned from you, which I'm very, very thankful for because everything to an extent at least I look at it, is kind of like an input and time and then output. So, like, let's say a good example is cold calling. Let's say you cold call two hours a day. You do a hundred calls an hour at one percent ABR, appointment booking rate. You book one appointment.\n\nYeah, one appointment.\n\nAnd really just the biggest thing there is, previously, I would think like, okay.\n\nThere has to be something that's wrong if I'm only booking one percent, but I didn't know how to diagnose that issue. So the mindset showed me how to diagnose that issue, and I'm like, okay. Maybe I need to change my opener, or maybe I need to change my tone or my mindset around cold calling. And then I changed that, and then I got to a five percent ABR, and now I'm booking five appointments an hour from.\n\nSo I think that's one of those things we'll do.\n\nI really think that, like, eighty percent of client acquisition is paradigm. It's just the way if you can learn to think scientifically and and think critically and make good decisions, like, realistically, you are most most people are probably five or six great decisions away from having enough appointments.\n\nBut they don't make them because they don't know what to do or how to see it. They just look for the best copy or the best script or the shiny object that basically helps them, but it doesn't help them because, you know, their mindset's sort of our place. I'd like to know this, Luke. So why do you start your agency? Right? I don't know how long ago you started, but what was the motivation for actually beginning in the first place?\n\nYeah. Great question. It was actually an Alex from Ozie interview, which has been great. Really?\n\nYeah. All about I don't I don't wanna, like, mess up the whole he has a whole, like, way of saying it, but pretty much the the main idea of it is just opportunity boat. And I was originally a real estate agent. Obviously, you're gonna be locked in on location.\n\nYou don't really have location freedom, financial freedom to an extent as well. And I kinda looked at it. Okay. So I'm already using a good amount of these systems in place, as an agent.\n\nAnd, really, the biggest thing was just me wanting to be in a position where I have full power over what my, I guess, you could say more so life or business at least looks like Because there is a lot of factors in that industry that you don't have in this industry. Yeah. Whereas you could the phone today, cold call, and you could have a client by the end of the week or by the end of the day. Whereas real estate, you're looking at thirty, sixty, ninety day timelines. So little bit of a difference there. Obviously, they all have their benefits and, I guess you could say positives and negatives to an extent, but that was really the biggest cardinal, I guess, change or idea.\n\nSlowestness. And when you started, did you think you'd be at fifty k a month as fast as you have been? Like, did you ever think that was gonna be possible?\n\nYeah. So kinda going back to it before, I like to say that ego kinda, like, got me in the door because I always looked at it as like, okay.\n\nAs it does for everyone, dude. People start SMA because they're either angry at themselves or because they have a huge ego.\n\nAnd there's nothing wrong with either those two things, but yeah. Yeah.\n\nA hundred percent. And I I really think the ego is is, like, the best thing in terms of getting me, like, my foot in the door, and that I had to humble myself to be able to actually reach that goal. So I think that was one of the biggest things where yeah. At the beginning, I was kinda like, I think I can do fifty k or a hundred k a month.\n\nI just I had a very limiting belief on, like, what those numbers were. So like I was telling you before, I had ten k on a pedestal. Mhmm. It was, like, insane to me.\n\nLike, holy oh my gosh. I could actually hit ten k a month. And then I hit it. I was like, okay.\n\nWell, this isn't really that bad.\n\nYeah. This is not this is not always made out to be. I think people who it's very easy to fall into the, celebration trap where, like, I wanna get ten k a month. I wanna get ten k a month.\n\nI wanna get and you get there, and then you're just like, I've made it. Yeah. And then, like, you think about it. It's like, dude, you're doing, like, six figures.\n\nWhen you minus expenses and strike fees and tax, you're probably only actually bringing home, like, five k a month, which isn't that impressive. So, like, you know but it makes sense.\n\nYeah. That was a big reality check after that first month.\n\nYou think do you think ten k a month makes, like, you unstoppable means you can buy anything you want.\n\nIt really doesn't. Like, you finance one nice car, and that's it. You're done. So Yeah.\n\nAnd I I think I think the biggest mindset shift that I've got from, like, you in particular is really just that everything to an extent, I wanna say is your in your control.\n\nJust because really, like I was talking about, just the input is the most important part. Because previously, I really looked at everything as kind of like a I don't wanna say luck, but I was like, okay. Maybe I'll book an appointment today. Whereas now I look as, okay.\n\nI'm Slacking today. I need to be putting in another hour or two hours of cold calling at minimum. I need to make sure all my emails are going out. I need to make sure we're converting, at the, obviously, range we wanna be converting at.\n\nAnd I think that's one of those things where previously, I was just so, I guess, unaware of Yeah.\n\nPeople people really struggle to distinguish, like, the causal effect. Like, they think that, like, business success is just like this weird thing that just, like, randomly strikes people and, like, oh, I booked an appointment. Oh my god. I'm so lucky.\n\nBut it's like, no. Like, every effect has a cause. You just have to look. And then if you know what the cause is, you can repeat the cause.\n\nBut but either way so my favorite part of the interview, now I and I'm gonna ask you to sell my thing for me. Right. Dude, in in all seriousness, though, if if let's say someone was in your position where they've been burned by a previous mentor or lack thereof, basically, which is the problem. They're thinking about easy grow, and they think, do you know what?\n\nLike, I'm just sort of on the fence. Like, what would you say to them? What sort of advice would you give to them? And what was your thought pattern going into it?\n\nYeah. I would say the biggest thing is if you're going to do it, and I would highly recommend it, obviously. Like, look at my experience.\n\nReally?\n\nLike, you know I would say I would say you have to look at it from a standpoint of, like, what can I really do to get in here and, like, get tactical with it?\n\nBecause I I got overwhelmed. I'm not gonna lie. At the beginning, I was like, alright. There's so much information here.\n\nLike, where do we start? And I think the best thing ever was just starting with the mindset because then a lot of that kind of I guess you could say it fills in a lot of the pieces mentally that you may potentially be lacking previously. Yeah. So, like, at the time, I didn't realize, okay.\n\nMaybe my ego is getting in the way, or maybe this is happening, or I'm not spending enough time on this. And then from there, I was able to utilize, all the information I learned and then kinda just blow everything up. And it was a very quick, upward trend Mhmm. Just because of the information you have in there.\n\nSo the scripts and all that goes.\n\nWanna make one thing clear to everyone watching.\n\nLuke has worked really, really hard. Like, the program is obviously part of the reason why, like, that unlocked the ability for him to get fifty k a month. But the reason he's there is because of him. Right?\n\nBecause, you know, you can give the program to a thousand people and, you know, nine hundred of them who don't do the work won't get results. So if anyone is thinking about joining this, I don't want you to look at Luke and think, oh, I can get fifty k a month in three months. Well, that'd be easy. Like, it's not easy.\n\nI'm sure you've been through some bloody hell to make this happen, man.\n\nThe program shows you what to do, but what you have to do, I must admit, is not very fun. So I just want everyone to be aware of that because, I'm sure the person who burned you before and sold that poor mentorship told you it was gonna be a walk in the park and well Yeah.\n\nYeah. It was a very big just, like, very easy like, you'll hit ten k the first three weeks or whatever it was or first month. It was Yeah. Pretty unrealistic.\n\nUsually, dude, I mean, this is why I love these interviews because, usually, like, if someone's coming into the program, like, I always say to them, dude, it's probably gonna take you, like, six months to hit ten k a month.\n\nLike, especially if you haven't got any previous experience, like, it's gonna take a long time. But in your instance where you've already had some business experience, you're doing ten k, all you need is just the right decisions and then bang, and it just, like, you know, you like it's like, I would liken it to this. Like, if you if you already have an agency that has a couple of clients, doesn't have to be ten grand a month. But if you're doing a couple of grand a month, you've got, like you've already the hard part of starting an agency is lighting the flame. You know, like, when you're on, like, you see, like, desert islands and they're trying to, like, light the fire, they spend most of their time lighting the fire. But as soon as they've got a little flame, then they can just put shit and shit on, which is what you've done here, essentially.\n\nYou've been kindling the flame prior to coming on board with us, which is why you've blown up so fast. And I don't want anyone who's watching this who doesn't have an agency yet to think they're gonna get randomly to fifty k a month in three months because it doesn't work like that, you know. You gotta build foundations first, but either way, in the spirit of transparency.\n\nLook. That's everything that all the questions that I have for you. I am so grateful for all your hard work and your commitment to the program and coming on to do this. Honestly, I lose touch sometimes with these client interviews because I do quite a few of them, and then, I sort of sometimes forget, like, oh, yeah.\n\nYou were doing ten grand a month. Now you're doing fifty grand a month. That's, like, a huge change. So congratulations.\n\nIn anything else you wanna say? Any anything that people can find you? Your personal brand or anything? What's going on there?\n\nYeah. Yeah. If you guys wanted to reach out to me, you can reach out to me on Instagram, or through school in the group. Mhmm. Luke, l u k e Mhmm. Soleila, s a l e l a.\n\nJust all one word for one So, guys, he's a real person.\n\nHe's not a paid actor. I promise you.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I could contest to that.\n\nCouldn't pay for the enthusiasm, man. It wouldn't work. So thank you so much, man.\n\nYeah. No. I appreciate it. Thank you, Charlie.\n\nCheers. Bye bye.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/6arq0ixnms?autoplay=0&wmode=transparent&wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

It's client interview time. Today I'm interviewing Luke, one of my clients. He joined us when we launched EZ Grow three months, that's three, three months ago.\n\nI thought I couldn't count for a second ago. Luke's got a pretty interesting story. He went from about ten k a month to sixty k a month over the course of three months. So throughout the interview, I'm gonna explore basically how he added fifty thousand dollars in new monthly revenue to his agency.\n\nI made a slight slip up throughout the interview where I referred to his growth going from ten to fifty k a month. He actually later corrected me saying he went from ten to sixty k a month. So I thought he had a forty grand in new monthly revenue. He actually had a fifty, so it's like six hundred k in your yearly revenue off the back of just one investment in Easy Grow, which I think he means got a pretty bloody good ROI, I'm pretty sure.\n\nBut either way, I wanna welcome you to the interview. Throughout this interview, I'm gonna be asking Luke questions about how he used the program, what systems he used. He's also gonna drop some knowledge on how he's built his agency and how he now has changed his mindset to do so. I'm really excited for this one.\n\nAnd, without further ado, let's take it away. Also, he shows his calendar. It's very exciting. Let's do it.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, welcome to another client interview for the channel. Today, I have the wonderful Luke, friend of mine, client of mine who's been working with us for it's been three months, I think, Luke. About three.\n\nYeah. Right around three months of February.\n\nThree months. Now this is a bit of a special one because on these client interviews, you know, typically, we're looking at adding, like, ten, twenty k in monthly revenue, which is pretty awesome to do that in three months or so. But Luke kind of thought, screw that. I'm gonna go a little bit above and beyond.\n\nAnd he went from ten k a month to fifty k a month. Basically, the forty thousand dollars in your monthly revenue or, you know, roughly five hundred k a month per year. Sorry. Not a month.\n\nThat'd be cool. Per year in revenue to his agency. And in this video, we're gonna talk about how Easy Grow helped him achieve that. For transparency, the purpose of this video is obviously to encourage you to schedule a call and buy from me.\n\nJust want that to be a help there because Luke knows how I operate. You know, this is obviously a sales sort of thing. But, also, I think it might give you some idea as to how to do that yourself. So, Luke, why don't you take a second just to introduce yourself, a bit about the agency, who you serve.\n\nAnd also, guys, Luke is gonna show you what his calendar looked like before and after the program, which is also which is pretty good. So take it away, man.\n\nYeah. One hundred percent. So, yeah, my name is Luke Soleila. I own luck agency.\n\nSo, yeah, we originally started around ten k. And after working with Charlie, we're now around eighteen to twenty clients, depending on just deposits. So that'll put us right around fifty k a month in added revenue, since when we started. And, yeah, the way we operate is a little bit different in the real estate niche, I guess you could say.\n\nWe charge pay upfront retainer. So we're right around about twenty five hundred to start. And then, yeah, we just work off of guarantee, obviously, all that good stuff, but that's kind of a little backing on how we operate. We work with real estate agents.\n\nSo run Facebook ads for them, book appointments, all that good stuff.\n\nSo So talking of appointments, let's see a calendar. So Luke showed me this. Yeah. Before we started the interview, he said, here's my calendar in, like, February.\n\nAnd you can see it.\n\nThis is January, February.\n\nYeah. So this was January. Really had no idea what I was doing. We're booking about probably ten to fifteen appointments the whole pretty much the whole month, unfortunately. And then same thing in February.\n\nJumped in in February, started working with Charlie. And then this is what March looks like. Getting a little better here, booking about trying to book around thirty a week, but weren't quite there. And that April really, really cleaned up to an extent.\n\nWe're locating probably about five to eight calls a day, give or take. And then, yeah, May, same exact thing. Last week, we had a little bit of a slow week, but we just picked up again this week. We're already booked it up next week.\n\nAnd just to let everyone know, Luke, am I paying you to say this?\n\nWe're not. Nope. Not not not at all.\n\nSo that's, we we haven't seen the calendars before, but, we'll talk about this. Because Luke's used a couple of systems from Easy Grow to basically achieve this, most notably the outbound systems. I think just just two of the fifteen we've got or something.\n\nSo Luke, let's let's start with the, the genesis of this journey. So, you mentioned before the interview, you'd been burned before. You bought a high ticket mentorship. Obviously, that comes with a lot of trust issues. Why don't you talk to people about how you were before you joined the program, where you're at in the agency, the struggles, everything, and we'll we'll sort of build up from there.\n\nYeah. Hundred percent.\n\nSo full transparency, I had a I had ten k a month on, like, a pretty big pedestal. So when I hit it, I hit it pretty quickly. So the thing with that is I immediately let off the gas because I thought, okay. So all the all the gurus, everybody on YouTube is like, you gotta hit ten k a month.\n\nAnd then it hit ten k a month, and it was probably the worst thing that ever happened to me, which sounds crazy, which is the opposite of what everyone else says. But the issue is as soon as I hit that ten k a month, my systems were really inconsistent leading up to it. So I was booking, like, we're I was showing you guys probably ten to fifteen appointments a month, cold calling maybe one or two times a week, and then sending probably a hundred, two hundred emails a week. Now kind of fast forward, we're booking, obviously, like, thirty calls a month or thirty calls a week.\n\nAnd the biggest thing there is just the consistency changed. So I had a moment that was a very, like a reality check, like I was telling Charlie. And the past program, that I took, they put no emphasis on service delivery.\n\nSo that was one of those things where I really didn't have a lot of help in booking, new appointments, and then I had no help with retaining clients. So when I I looked for, I guess, a better mentor, a better path, I saw Charlie was very heavy on service, was very heavy on, obviously, booking appointments. So that's kinda where that decision came from. And especially with the past experience I had, I was very hesitant at the beginning, and then just more client interviews like the one we're doing now.\n\nYeah. They were one of those, man.\n\nYeah. Was one of the best ones.\n\nAnd then, yeah, that that was just one of those things where I was like, you know what? I will take a chance.\n\nAnd then just a lot of it was accountability, especially from everybody in the course, or program, and then, also the cost and all of that. And, yeah, I think that was really the, I guess, you could say, pivotal point, in terms of where we're at now.\n\nShout out to Seb, sales rep. Wonderful guy. Okay. So you'd seen some client interviews. You'd you've been burned before. You got to that point where ten k a month, either you you achieved some comfort or basically you just, like, it's it's inconsistent.\n\nSo you seem like a very I can imagine, because I didn't speak to you before, but I can imagine you're a very different person now. Do you wanna touch briefly on the mindset shifts and the paradigm shifts that happened as a result of the content and going to the program?\n\nA hundred percent. So I think that is actually the most important part of the whole entire program because I didn't realize I was kind of I don't wanna say I was not a hundred percent bought in on the whole mindset, until I really got into it because I used to always hear mindset is everything, and I was kinda like, yeah. I know you got to put everything.\n\nTotally not.\n\nLike Yeah.\n\nYeah. You can't do the whole thing. And that was truly a hundred percent transparency. That was the part that was really missing because the issue before is I was doing things, and I didn't know why I was doing them. So I would do, like, an eight hour day, in the office, and four hours of those were spent on YouTube watching, like, guru videos on how to do certain things.\n\nAnd I was like Sorry about that.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd at at at the time, I was like, okay. I'm actually doing something unproductive. And then I look at my calendar. I'm like, okay.\n\nI have no appointments booked. I have no pretty much revenue coming in. I barely hit ten k a month. And then, after going through the mindset training, self transcendence, all that good stuff, Mhmm.\n\nReally, the biggest thing I learned, which I think is priceless, personally, is just self awareness. So now I know okay. Like, I'm extremely like, there's certain times throughout the day. I know everybody has them where I'm like, okay.\n\nMaybe I could just take an hour here and watch this video.\n\nGame of Thrones can't hurt anyone. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd then now I realize, okay. That compounds. So if I spend ten minutes here, and then I spend another twenty minutes here, and I spend another hour here, before I know it, third of my day or a quarter of my day is spent watching YouTube when I could be doing outbound.\n\nDude, I think you just call out basically everyone watching this. Like Yeah. Oh, exactly. YouTube, guys. Stop masturbating to success and just start doing some work. So so now you're doing fifty k fifty k a month. You added forty grand in monthly revenue.\n\nTell me how I mean, I can't I don't know about you. The lifestyle change between ten grand a month and fifty grand a month might not be that significant. But would you mind touching on, like, how that has impacted you, like, how you feel? I mean, that'd be I'm sure that you truly feel pretty good.\n\nYeah. Yeah. The biggest thing I would say overall is just the kind of the mindset of going into it is now it went from very inconsistent, like, okay. I'm afraid of losing clients.\n\nI don't know if I'm gonna be able to get another client to now I'm in a position where, really worth a lot of it was a self transcendence and just know okay. I'm self aware now. If I know I need to be putting in more time, let's say, Monday or Tuesday to make sure I have appointments booked Thursday and Friday, I know I'm capable of that. So a lot more comfortable not comfortable, but I would say a lot more confident or more convicted, just in the product, the service, all that good stuff, and then really just my ability to, produce and book those appointments so I can get new clients and all that.\n\nLove it, man. So you talked about appointment booking.\n\nAre you still doing the appointment booking, or have you got people in place, SOPs and stuff from the program?\n\nYes. So one of the biggest things that I actually learned from the mindset training was ego. So I had a very, very large ego, I'll be transparent, leading up to this.\n\nAny anyone that says they had a large ego doesn't have a large ego anymore because they recognize it. Carry on.\n\nYep. A hundred percent. And that was really what was holding me back. I had a mindset that I'm I don't wanna say I'm too good, but I at the at the time, I thought I was too good to cold call. I thought I was too good to get rejected on the phone, all that kind of stuff. And, like, you were talking about going through the pain in the fire, that was what made the biggest difference. It's just me getting on the phone calling.\n\nAnd, yeah, at the beginning, before when I was calling, it was terrible. And then after I started learning proper scripts, all the types of stuff you were teaching, it made a huge difference because then it went from, I'm just getting rejected all day long to, oh my gosh. I'm actually booking appointments. Yeah. So Big difference there. Yeah.\n\nIt's kinda worth it. So the so you're doing the sales calls. So are you still doing cold calls yourself, or do you have people to do it for you now?\n\nYeah. Yeah. I still do everything. So I personally want to cold call all the way up to a hundred k a month, potentially two hundred k a month just because I think that's, like, the most humbling experience.\n\nMhmm. And right around forty percent of our well, yeah, forty percent of the closed clients we have now have come from cold calls. Mhmm.\n\nSo I think a big thing there is just, like, an extra personal connection that I wouldn't normally get with a cold email, if that makes sense.\n\nMakes sense. Well, what about the other sixty percent? Where have they come from?\n\nCold email.\n\nSo From the looms?\n\nOr no.\n\nSo I did a hybrid of the loom and, just like a cold email copy with the offer and all that. And then, yeah, that was kind of how it started, and then we've just been building it up over time. And now we're going kind of a more mass approach right around three to four hundred emails a day. Cool. Yeah, that's made a big difference.\n\nDude, thirty appointments a week. You can't argue with that, man. Do you take all the sales calls yourself?\n\nI do. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nYou don't stop, man. I love it. I bloody love it. So fifty k a month at the moment, what is next for for luck agency? What do you wanna do next?\n\nGreat question. So right now, I've been reinvesting most of the money just back into the product, because I think that's a big thing that's been missing. At least with all the other, people that I've seen on the Internet, you were one of the main ones who actually talked about product. And I think that's the most important part, product service, all that, because the worst feeling I ever had was losing those clients at the beginning.\n\nSo and that was one of those things where I think everybody's just so worried about selling, selling, selling. But when you lose fifty percent or seventy five percent of your business because you have a bad product, it ruins the whole experience. So that was one of those things where I've been, religiously just trying to figure out a way to build a better IT team, build better ads, build better systems in place. That was one of those things where I took a lot of cues and hints and a lot of information from you guys' follow-up processes and all that.\n\nIt's interesting, man, because, well, it's there's two points there. First, what you just said, when, like, we teach acquisition. Right?\n\nAnd what people don't realize is you can take the lessons that we teach in acquisition and imply that to your service delivery. Like, people think service delivery and client acquisition will be two different things. But, realistically, if you're doing marketing, service delivery is client acquisition from the business, so you can apply it.\n\nWhat else was I gonna say? I was gonna say something else that was quite important, but it's, like, just completely skipped my mind.\n\nNo. That's it. So through the program because you talked a lot about the mindset training.\n\nHow much of the mindset stuff what what do you think the percentage difference is in in terms of the result? Like, Would you attribute the mindset training to, like, seventy five percent of the results? Because this is the thing, like, guys, if you're watching this and you wanna buy Easybro, I need you to do the mindset training.\n\nSo I need I wanna, like, get everyone to do it because it's, like, completely life changing.\n\nBut yeah.\n\nYeah. I look at kind of now I look at everything in more of, like, a systemized approach, which I learned from you, which I'm very, very thankful for because everything to an extent at least I look at it, is kind of like an input and time and then output. So, like, let's say a good example is cold calling. Let's say you cold call two hours a day. You do a hundred calls an hour at one percent ABR, appointment booking rate. You book one appointment.\n\nYeah, one appointment.\n\nAnd really just the biggest thing there is, previously, I would think like, okay.\n\nThere has to be something that's wrong if I'm only booking one percent, but I didn't know how to diagnose that issue. So the mindset showed me how to diagnose that issue, and I'm like, okay. Maybe I need to change my opener, or maybe I need to change my tone or my mindset around cold calling. And then I changed that, and then I got to a five percent ABR, and now I'm booking five appointments an hour from.\n\nSo I think that's one of those things we'll do.\n\nI really think that, like, eighty percent of client acquisition is paradigm. It's just the way if you can learn to think scientifically and and think critically and make good decisions, like, realistically, you are most most people are probably five or six great decisions away from having enough appointments.\n\nBut they don't make them because they don't know what to do or how to see it. They just look for the best copy or the best script or the shiny object that basically helps them, but it doesn't help them because, you know, their mindset's sort of our place. I'd like to know this, Luke. So why do you start your agency? Right? I don't know how long ago you started, but what was the motivation for actually beginning in the first place?\n\nYeah. Great question. It was actually an Alex from Ozie interview, which has been great. Really?\n\nYeah. All about I don't I don't wanna, like, mess up the whole he has a whole, like, way of saying it, but pretty much the the main idea of it is just opportunity boat. And I was originally a real estate agent. Obviously, you're gonna be locked in on location.\n\nYou don't really have location freedom, financial freedom to an extent as well. And I kinda looked at it. Okay. So I'm already using a good amount of these systems in place, as an agent.\n\nAnd, really, the biggest thing was just me wanting to be in a position where I have full power over what my, I guess, you could say more so life or business at least looks like Because there is a lot of factors in that industry that you don't have in this industry. Yeah. Whereas you could the phone today, cold call, and you could have a client by the end of the week or by the end of the day. Whereas real estate, you're looking at thirty, sixty, ninety day timelines. So little bit of a difference there. Obviously, they all have their benefits and, I guess you could say positives and negatives to an extent, but that was really the biggest cardinal, I guess, change or idea.\n\nSlowestness. And when you started, did you think you'd be at fifty k a month as fast as you have been? Like, did you ever think that was gonna be possible?\n\nYeah. So kinda going back to it before, I like to say that ego kinda, like, got me in the door because I always looked at it as like, okay.\n\nAs it does for everyone, dude. People start SMA because they're either angry at themselves or because they have a huge ego.\n\nAnd there's nothing wrong with either those two things, but yeah. Yeah.\n\nA hundred percent. And I I really think the ego is is, like, the best thing in terms of getting me, like, my foot in the door, and that I had to humble myself to be able to actually reach that goal. So I think that was one of the biggest things where yeah. At the beginning, I was kinda like, I think I can do fifty k or a hundred k a month.\n\nI just I had a very limiting belief on, like, what those numbers were. So like I was telling you before, I had ten k on a pedestal. Mhmm. It was, like, insane to me.\n\nLike, holy oh my gosh. I could actually hit ten k a month. And then I hit it. I was like, okay.\n\nWell, this isn't really that bad.\n\nYeah. This is not this is not always made out to be. I think people who it's very easy to fall into the, celebration trap where, like, I wanna get ten k a month. I wanna get ten k a month.\n\nI wanna get and you get there, and then you're just like, I've made it. Yeah. And then, like, you think about it. It's like, dude, you're doing, like, six figures.\n\nWhen you minus expenses and strike fees and tax, you're probably only actually bringing home, like, five k a month, which isn't that impressive. So, like, you know but it makes sense.\n\nYeah. That was a big reality check after that first month.\n\nYou think do you think ten k a month makes, like, you unstoppable means you can buy anything you want.\n\nIt really doesn't. Like, you finance one nice car, and that's it. You're done. So Yeah.\n\nAnd I I think I think the biggest mindset shift that I've got from, like, you in particular is really just that everything to an extent, I wanna say is your in your control.\n\nJust because really, like I was talking about, just the input is the most important part. Because previously, I really looked at everything as kind of like a I don't wanna say luck, but I was like, okay. Maybe I'll book an appointment today. Whereas now I look as, okay.\n\nI'm Slacking today. I need to be putting in another hour or two hours of cold calling at minimum. I need to make sure all my emails are going out. I need to make sure we're converting, at the, obviously, range we wanna be converting at.\n\nAnd I think that's one of those things where previously, I was just so, I guess, unaware of Yeah.\n\nPeople people really struggle to distinguish, like, the causal effect. Like, they think that, like, business success is just like this weird thing that just, like, randomly strikes people and, like, oh, I booked an appointment. Oh my god. I'm so lucky.\n\nBut it's like, no. Like, every effect has a cause. You just have to look. And then if you know what the cause is, you can repeat the cause.\n\nBut but either way so my favorite part of the interview, now I and I'm gonna ask you to sell my thing for me. Right. Dude, in in all seriousness, though, if if let's say someone was in your position where they've been burned by a previous mentor or lack thereof, basically, which is the problem. They're thinking about easy grow, and they think, do you know what?\n\nLike, I'm just sort of on the fence. Like, what would you say to them? What sort of advice would you give to them? And what was your thought pattern going into it?\n\nYeah. I would say the biggest thing is if you're going to do it, and I would highly recommend it, obviously. Like, look at my experience.\n\nReally?\n\nLike, you know I would say I would say you have to look at it from a standpoint of, like, what can I really do to get in here and, like, get tactical with it?\n\nBecause I I got overwhelmed. I'm not gonna lie. At the beginning, I was like, alright. There's so much information here.\n\nLike, where do we start? And I think the best thing ever was just starting with the mindset because then a lot of that kind of I guess you could say it fills in a lot of the pieces mentally that you may potentially be lacking previously. Yeah. So, like, at the time, I didn't realize, okay.\n\nMaybe my ego is getting in the way, or maybe this is happening, or I'm not spending enough time on this. And then from there, I was able to utilize, all the information I learned and then kinda just blow everything up. And it was a very quick, upward trend Mhmm. Just because of the information you have in there.\n\nSo the scripts and all that goes.\n\nWanna make one thing clear to everyone watching.\n\nLuke has worked really, really hard. Like, the program is obviously part of the reason why, like, that unlocked the ability for him to get fifty k a month. But the reason he's there is because of him. Right?\n\nBecause, you know, you can give the program to a thousand people and, you know, nine hundred of them who don't do the work won't get results. So if anyone is thinking about joining this, I don't want you to look at Luke and think, oh, I can get fifty k a month in three months. Well, that'd be easy. Like, it's not easy.\n\nI'm sure you've been through some bloody hell to make this happen, man.\n\nThe program shows you what to do, but what you have to do, I must admit, is not very fun. So I just want everyone to be aware of that because, I'm sure the person who burned you before and sold that poor mentorship told you it was gonna be a walk in the park and well Yeah.\n\nYeah. It was a very big just, like, very easy like, you'll hit ten k the first three weeks or whatever it was or first month. It was Yeah. Pretty unrealistic.\n\nUsually, dude, I mean, this is why I love these interviews because, usually, like, if someone's coming into the program, like, I always say to them, dude, it's probably gonna take you, like, six months to hit ten k a month.\n\nLike, especially if you haven't got any previous experience, like, it's gonna take a long time. But in your instance where you've already had some business experience, you're doing ten k, all you need is just the right decisions and then bang, and it just, like, you know, you like it's like, I would liken it to this. Like, if you if you already have an agency that has a couple of clients, doesn't have to be ten grand a month. But if you're doing a couple of grand a month, you've got, like you've already the hard part of starting an agency is lighting the flame. You know, like, when you're on, like, you see, like, desert islands and they're trying to, like, light the fire, they spend most of their time lighting the fire. But as soon as they've got a little flame, then they can just put shit and shit on, which is what you've done here, essentially.\n\nYou've been kindling the flame prior to coming on board with us, which is why you've blown up so fast. And I don't want anyone who's watching this who doesn't have an agency yet to think they're gonna get randomly to fifty k a month in three months because it doesn't work like that, you know. You gotta build foundations first, but either way, in the spirit of transparency.\n\nLook. That's everything that all the questions that I have for you. I am so grateful for all your hard work and your commitment to the program and coming on to do this. Honestly, I lose touch sometimes with these client interviews because I do quite a few of them, and then, I sort of sometimes forget, like, oh, yeah.\n\nYou were doing ten grand a month. Now you're doing fifty grand a month. That's, like, a huge change. So congratulations.\n\nIn anything else you wanna say? Any anything that people can find you? Your personal brand or anything? What's going on there?\n\nYeah. Yeah. If you guys wanted to reach out to me, you can reach out to me on Instagram, or through school in the group. Mhmm. Luke, l u k e Mhmm. Soleila, s a l e l a.\n\nJust all one word for one So, guys, he's a real person.\n\nHe's not a paid actor. I promise you.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I could contest to that.\n\nCouldn't pay for the enthusiasm, man. It wouldn't work. So thank you so much, man.\n\nYeah. No. I appreciate it. Thank you, Charlie.\n\nCheers. Bye bye."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}}, {});
