I'm smiling quite a lot here because I just finished a client interview with a client of mine, and I would also, at this point, call him a very good friend, Eric, who went from nothing, zero, absolutely nothing, right, all the way to thirty thousand dollars per month as a dropout with no previous sales experience, no previous service delivery experience, no previous appointment booking experience. The dude went from nothing to thirty grand a month, and now he basically just travels Greece and does whatever the hell he wants.\n\nThis video is basically me interviewing him to find out exactly what the hell went on, how he did it. And he sort of breaks down step by step how he worked with us and what he did to sort of do that. And there's all sorts of little gems throughout here, so you can go planning for gold as you go through this video. But I'm over the bloody moon, man.\n\nLike, Eric's put a lot of work in, and, I just had a really heartfelt chat with him after the interview. And I love my work, man. I love it so much. And that's all I really have to say for the introduction.\n\nSo I hope you find this video useful, and, if you did, then you can always do the whole liking thing. But either way, I'm gonna get into the interview now. I will see you in there. Alright.\n\nHey, everyone. How's it going? And welcome back to another client interview.\n\nI'm really excited today to be talking to Eric, who is a client of mine, but also a friend of mine at this point.\n\nEric has basically done what most people consider to be impossible, going from zero dollars a month to thirty thousand dollars per month as a complete beginner with a social media marketing agency in the space of five months. Now that's pretty impressive, so I wanted to bring Eric on and interview him. He's been going through our program, and I wanted to get to the bottom of how he's done, what he's done. So, Eric, why don't you just start by introducing yourself, maybe tell people who you are, what niche you're in, where you're from, and all all that good stuff.\n\nYeah. For sure. So, hello, everyone. I'm, Eric Tablas. I'm originally from Vancouver, but I kinda live up in Whistler and, just over in Canada.\n\nBut, but, yeah, I'm twenty years old. I'm, I at the time when I joined, it was, September first, and now it's, like, February at the time recording this. But, but, yeah, I, I was in, like, third year university.\n\nAnd, but, yeah, now I'm just, pretty much just, like, traveling in, in Europe with a few other guys in the space and, living the laptop lifestyle. It's it's super fun. And, yeah, I'm I'm in the I'm in the real estate niche. So yeah.\n\nAmazing. So we'll touch on the laptop lifestyle thing because I think a lot of people watching this interview, and a lot of people who consider buying our program and stuff, like, one of their ultimate goals is to have that location freedom.\n\nSo if I'm not mistaken, so five months ago when you were starting, you didn't have the ability to just jet off to Greece when you wanted to. That's that's something that's happened recently. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Pretty much. Where have you been?\n\nWhere are you going?\n\nI honestly don't know. We're kinda just just gallivanting around Europe right now, but we were just in just in Portugal now. I honestly have no idea where we're gonna go next. It's, pretty pretty spontaneous. But, yeah, like, when I was at least, like, when I was first starting out, like or just when I first joined the program, like, before that, I was just, yeah, just going to university.\n\nMy goal didn't really align with what what was gonna happen if I didn't make a change. Mhmm.\n\nBecause something over the summer kinda clicked where I was like, fuck. If I don't make a change, like, I'm actually gonna be working on this.\n\nWhat do you think that what do you think that thing was? Because because what what what I wanna do, and I'm sure everyone's curious to know, is, like, where you were before the program. Because we can look at where you are now and stuff, but I think tracking back the genesis of that sort of, like, click. Was it a conversation you had, or did you just sort of think, like, fuck. I'm gonna end up, like, with a life that I hate if I'm not careful. Like, what was the impression?\n\nYeah. I was like, well, yeah. Like, first of all, I probably wouldn't wouldn't have ever, like, let myself actually get into that situation with, like, the nine to five. But, like, the whole realization was it kinda just happened in, like, May.\n\nAnd I was like, fuck. Like, I I need to, like, change something. Yeah. But, yeah, I pretty much just, like I honestly just started watching YouTube videos, and then I just started binge watching, like, everything, like, the the client interviews. And I I pretty much just, like, made a plan that I was going to pretty much drop out or, like, just stop university Mhmm. And just start the program on September first.\n\nAnd then pretty much from there, it's, it's been quite the journey, and now we're, now we're here.\n\nSo Dude, it makes me so happy, man.\n\nSo so you were basically what what were you studying in university? Was it business or something like that?\n\nYeah. Business studies. Yeah. It was like consumer behavior. So they're kinda like psychology and marketing, but I can be honest.\n\nLike, I didn't learn anything. That's usually how it goes. Yeah. Like, the stuff that I'm learning with the program and just overall, like, on the Internet is Yeah.\n\nIt's like you can't even really compare it to what I was learning in university because it's so, like, outdated and just not, like, useful information that I was learning in, in uni.\n\nBut So I Oh, yeah. A lot of questions. So so when you're at university studying business because I dropped out of university as well, and we've had a lot of other clients drop out to start the program, do similar thing to you. Yeah. Did you have this feeling that, like, you didn't fit in?\n\nWhere, like, you sort of had a different mindset or a different way of seeing the world, and you were really ambitious, and everyone else was sort of just, like, not not blind, but everyone's felt like an NPC, and then you're there, like, actually Yeah.\n\nLike, what how did you feel about how did that happen for you, and what was that like?\n\nYeah. A hundred percent. Yeah. Like, when I was it it really hit me when I was in my, like it was like a personal finance, like, lecture.\n\nAnd, like, the professor was like, well, yeah. This is, like, what we're doing. We're pretty much just gonna be showing you guys, and you're pretty much going to university to get, like, you know, the best job out of university. Yeah.\n\nEveryone kind of agreed, and now it's just like Chat.\n\nSitting there, like, Hold on.\n\nSo, yeah, I I kinda just like and it just from now on, it's, like, such a disconnect from from pretty much, like, every night university. It's, I don't, like, feel the same anymore.\n\nSo Yeah.\n\nNo. I hear you're a different person, man. You've grown. So when when you so you dropped out of university and you formulate this plan, you you binge watch the content, watch client interviews.\n\nWhat was the initial goal? Like, did you did you wanna get to thirty grand a month straight away, or was it getting the first few clients? Like, what what was that sort of was it ten k a month? Like, what was the first goal you wanted to hit when you dropped out?\n\nHonestly, I was, like, pretty ambitious. Like, I was viewing ten k a month as, like, not the actual goal, but definitely, like, a a milestone I want to hit.\n\nLike Yep.\n\nI was definitely wanting to be hidden. I remember, like, just watching, Luca's interview just so many times. Like, we've been doing, like, ten to three weeks, and and now now I'm there.\n\nSo Yep.\n\nSo yeah. But I don't think there was, like, really a goal. It was more just, like, I wanted to get to a point where I didn't have to, like, work the nine to five and also just, like, make a a shit ton of money. But Yeah. But yeah.\n\nSo your your goal was less like, you sort of wanted to get ten grand a month, but for you, it was more about the sort of time freedom, location freedom, freedom of movement, like, just being able to go where you want, when you want, with who you want without having to ask to anyone.\n\nThat's sort of what the what the goal was.\n\nYeah. But now you've done it, man.\n\nThat's such a good that's such a good feeling, bro.\n\nIt is. Yeah. Like, the money was pretty much just like a it was, yeah, just like a vehicle to in order for me to, like, do whatever I want. And I also just, like, hate being restrained by anything. So, like, the money just pretty much allowed that to for me to, like, not being, restrained by anything. Because it's it's actually it's such a weird feeling because, you know, usually when you went traveling, like, in the past, were you in, like, university or, like, or, like, in high school? And, like, it was and you're always, like, thinking, like, oh, I gotta go back soon, and I gotta go back to, like, normal life.\n\nBut I I just, like, don't have go back, man.\n\nYou you just stay there forever.\n\nI've never been to it like that, actually. That's a good point. Yeah. It's, it's pretty good.\n\nSo let's get let's get to the the nuts and bolts, the parts that people are probably quite interested in, in terms of how you use the program to do it. So if I think it'd be helpful for everyone if you sort of mapped out, like, in what order did you consume the the the content? But more importantly, like, what actions did you take to get that result so quickly? Because a lot of our clients, it it could take them, like, it could take them a year to get to thirty grand a month.\n\nIt depends on, like, how quickly they do it, what their mindset's like. When everyone signs clients and everyone sort of breaks free, so to speak, but you've done it in a very fast period of time. And, you know, for full transparency with everyone watching this, like, Eric is an example of what you can achieve with the program, but it is an anomaly. You're you're an exception.\n\nYou know? To get from zero to thirty with no previous experiences is is is difficult to do as possible. But most people might, you know, in the in the first few months might get to, you know, eight grand a month, ten grand a month. So you've done it differently.\n\nSo Yeah. Walk everyone through sort of the linear steps that you took and how you use the program to to accomplish this result.\n\nYeah. So, like, I guess, like, starting off, it was pretty much me just making a plan to go into, like, a super, like, I guess, deep monk mode when it comes to things Mhmm. Start being, like, first pretty much. So I I moved up to, like, Worcester, which is, like, kinda two hours north of Vancouver and pretty much, like, it's a super small town, and I just have, like, a house up there. So I pretty much just I not, like, ghosted everyone, but I just pretty much just, like, delete all social media, didn't really talk to anyone, just pretty much just, like, wanted to transform, like, my mind into, like, a mental, like, metam almost.\n\nAnd then, yeah, from there, I pretty much just, first of all, just started watching the mindset. I was, like, completely, just completely blown away.\n\nGood. Yeah. That was self transcended.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was something I've, like, never seen before. So, yeah, I learned about, like, paradigms and all that stuff, and I just consistently was hitting so many paradigm shifts, like, over, like, the the past months, like, since joining. Mhmm. But, yeah, at least, like, for kind of what really moved the needle the needle was, like, probably the looms.\n\nI got to a point when I was I had, like, an insane booking rate. It's, like, about ten percent, That's great. Like That's great. Like nuts.\n\nSo, and then, yeah, pretty much also cold calling.\n\nThat helped a lot, and that was also, like right now, it's, like, one meeting booked out of every, like, ten dials, which is, like, insane as well.\n\nSo And this is in the real estate niche.\n\nRight?\n\nYeah. So, yeah, these numbers might be, you know, a bit, bit inflated compared to, you know, other niches, like the gym niche or whatever. But, but, yeah, like, pretty much, I just kept on staying consistent. And then I was, like, you know, doing some, like, thirty day free trials, at the start, and I was charging, like, super low, like, seven fifty setups.\n\nAnd then now I'm I'm doing, like, way higher ticket, like, four thousand to, like, five thousand setups and then just twenty five percent commission after that.\n\nSo How did you feel about the sales thing?\n\nBecause had you ever done a sales call in your life before starting your agency? No.\n\nI was like So you just just did the training, and you were like, yeah.\n\nGo on. I'll just give it a go.\n\nYeah. I, yeah, I honestly had, like I I had no idea what I was doing. I remember I was just, like, super nervous the first few times. But, honestly, you just gotta do what you gotta do. Like, I I was kinda just, like, seen as, like, a, I guess, like, learning experience. I wasn't at least for, like, the first few few sales calls, and I just got, you know, better and better from that.\n\nBut And you use the the script in the program to do the sales calls or did yeah.\n\nYeah. Hundred percent.\n\nWhat what about service delivery? Because, obviously, we do a lot of service delivery in the program. Did you use any of that stuff? Or because I I know that you're also mentored by by Ishmael, who's another one of our clients as as well. Did did he help you with the service delivery, or was that was it sort of split of both?\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Ishmael showed me his service delivery, but, I kind of I guess he kinda gave me the foundations, and you guys also gave me the foundations as well. Mhmm. And I kinda, like, built off from that. So I was I was, like, showing the, when I was doing when I do, like, sales calls, I show them, like, the the golden follow-up system.\n\nOh, yeah. That little that little shiny apple. Yeah. Just watch our eyebrows just lift. Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo I think that's like a I think that's a good sorry to interrupt.\n\nI think that's a good a good thing for people to know. From when you're doing sales calls, like, what what we've learned and what Eric just explained is, like, don't tell people, show them. So it's you can tell someone, like, hey. We've got a system to get people to show up.\n\nBut, like, if you can actually if you if you show it mapped out in a nice pretty Miro board and you explain, like, well, this is exactly how it works, like, that alone gives so much more strength than because I'm assuming you do you do a probably a similar thing with, like, your ads and your funnels and stuff and, like, you know, when you're when you're walking people through it. So that's important. So if if you don't mind me asking, Eric, what what's the best day you've had sales wise? So five months ago, you were a different person making no money, just dropped out of uni.\n\nFast forward five months, in the last month or two, what's the best day you've ever done, cash wise?\n\nYeah. So it was a six k day, but it was supposed to be, supposed to be a ten k day, but a deal just fell through. So, but, I mean, I should be hitting a ten k day, probably within the next, like, two weeks or so if, if, like, if I just signed two clients in a day, but at at five k. But but yeah.\n\nIt's like That's that's by the way, that's that's cash collected.\n\nRight? That's not like Yeah. Yeah. Retainers coming in in a few months. That's like upfront setup fees. Right?\n\nYeah. That's that's all setup fees.\n\nBecause if we're if we're talking, like, like, retainers or, like, commission, like, I guess, deals. Yeah. Those could be I could be getting paid up to, like, fifty k in, like, a year from from one line, from, like, commission. So, but, yeah, like, at least, like, for, like, setup fees is cash collected. And that's, like, pretty much that's, like, all profit as well. So Yeah.\n\nThat's the thing. Like, the margins are, like, super high in in agencies.\n\nSo So five months ago, zero dropout, had no clue what you were doing, but you went monk mode.\n\nYou come out of monk mode. You know, four months later, you go traveling. You're now doing thirty grand a month.\n\nHow how the fuck does it feel?\n\nLike, knowing that you've actually seen you you you sort of in your mind, you imagined a life you wanted to have, I. E. Financial freedom, location freedom, having enough money to basically say fuck you to everyone. Like, how the fuck does it feel? What's the what's the main emotion that you feel when it comes to the success you've achieved?\n\nOr is it not quite registered yet?\n\nYeah. It's, you know, it's it's it's definitely it feels like quite something, but it feels like it was just meant to be. Like, it feels like it was just supposed to happen. Mhmm.\n\nBecause yeah. It's it's it's such a good feeling, though, just knowing that I'm just making, like, so much, and I have to, like, work a nine to five ever pretty much. I could just, like, do whatever I want. I don't have anything restraining me, and it's, it's super nice.\n\nAnd I'm I'm, like, also just traveling with, like, such a good group of guys, and we're all doing, like, pretty similar numbers. So it's, it's super nice to kinda just, like, build off off each other and stuff. So Yeah. But, yeah, it's it's super nice.\n\nLike, going to the gym every day, just, you know, exploring Greece and Europe overall. So Mhmm. So yeah. But yeah.\n\nIt's I just have, like, such a good feeling every night knowing that I'm in this in this, like, parallel universe and not a different parallel universe, like, in, like, a nine to five. But then again, I probably wouldn't ever kinda, I guess, like, let myself be in that position.\n\nBut Yeah.\n\nWell, you do anything. You you do anything you could to escape it if you really wanted to. I think that's that's something that, you know I mean, you've probably put yourself through a lot of work. I mean, obviously, you know, you can you can look at the program and attribute, you know, our program at Easy Grow to your success, but I think that a lot of it comes down to you and how much you worked.\n\nYou know? So I think that's important. So Yeah. Here's a question. So what's next?\n\nLike, where where do you wanna scale to next? What's your because I'm assuming you're not well, I mean, you you could be. It'd be fine if you were, but I'm assuming you're not just gonna sit back and get comfortable on a sunbed. So what Oh, yeah. The what what's the next goal? What's the next level of universe you want to achieve?\n\nYeah. We're we're just getting just getting started here. So, yeah, I'm thinking of, like, definitely a hundred k a month.\n\nI'm not exactly sure what the time frame is that gonna be like, but if I, you know, could pull it off by the end of twenty twenty three, that'd be amazing. But it's it's gonna be hard to, I guess, stay consistent with that just like because as you know, like, when you scale, you run into, like, shit ton of problems.\n\nSo You're gonna face all sorts of shit you didn't know you needed to fix.\n\nI think Yeah. I've already been to yeah.\n\nI I think the natural progression is, like, I think the hardest and you can prop you'll probably find this the hardest is going from, like, zero to, like, ten or twenty. Because that's like you have to go from civilian to business owner, and that's really hard. But I think, like, I think where most people plateau is when they need to decentralize their business. So it's when they need to start hiring people and replacing themselves and building systems.\n\nThat's when they that's when it goes wrong. So I think it's possible. I mean, you're you're an easy grow, so you won't find it too hard. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Exactly. So Yeah.\n\nSo here's here's the question where I get you to essentially sell the program for me. But Oh, yeah.\n\nWell, I was talking to Eric at the start before before he started, and he said he wants as many people to buy as as possible. So so if you what would you say to someone who's watching this and wants to is thinking about, you know, booking call or investing in the program, like, who was in the same boat as you? Like, what would you say to them as a as a result? Like, would you yeah. I'll just leave that as an open ended question.\n\nI'm gonna say as, like, Luca said it, just, like, buy the fucking programs. Like but, yeah, that that is so how I frame it as, like, this program is essentially, like, a one way ticket from you to get to where I was to essentially just, like, freedom in all areas of your life, like location, time, and, like, financial freedom.\n\nYeah.\n\nI would just do it, but only do it if you're willing to put in the work and, like, actually, you wanna actually change your life.\n\nBecause if you're kinda, like, you know, half assing it, it I mean, it still works, but you're not gonna get the results as fast.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd it's not gonna be as, like, I guess, meaningful for you. So but, yeah, I would hundred percent join. It's, you know, amazing community. I've talked to, like, so many so many people in there.\n\nI'm already, like, you know, meeting up with, with a few guys in a few months. Like, also, like, you and just my, like, mentor, Ishmael, and a few other guys. I'm actually think I'm doing, like, a podcast with some of them. So, yeah, community is, like, amazing because that's the thing.\n\nLike, I was thinking about this. And if I didn't join, I don't know where I would be, but I probably wouldn't be in Greece right now. And I probably because that's the thing, like, about entrepreneurship is it's such a, like, lonely path.\n\nMhmm.\n\nAnd if you don't have a community to back you up, things get super lonely sometimes. So Yeah. If you're just always surrounding yourself with, you know, people very similar to you, just like even, like, just online in the community, you're gonna grow way faster and feel like, I guess, like, more fulfilled and just, like, connected because you can get it's like a super, super lonely path.\n\nThat's sort of how I see it is it's like it's kind of like if if you imagine that and this is gonna sound really sort of, like, philosophical and hippie stuff. But, like, if you imagine that success is, like, just a really, like is a really dark path. Like, you there's a long there's a path, but it's just pitch black. It's like the mentor is the person who holds the light at the end of the path and says, right.\n\nThis is the direction you go. But, like, if you try and walk that on your own, you're gonna get you're gonna go mad. So if you if you do it with, like, a bunch of people and and they're all walking to the same light, like, it's way it's way easier. Yeah.\n\nSo well, I I promise I'm not sure.\n\nSorry. Go ahead.\n\nI was gonna say I promise that your bit wasn't scripted. Oh, we've done it, mate. We've done the interrupt problem.\n\nI was gonna say I I promise that the bit where you just ran it on about how Gray is wasn't scripted just for for for.\n\nGuys.\n\nYeah. But you but you go on, mate. What were you gonna say? Oh, no.\n\nI was just saying, like, the the path of success, how you're saying, like, the, like, the dark, path, it's it's pretty much just like a shit ton of pain that's, like, loaded up, and you have to get through all that pain to, like Yeah. Get to that tunnel. Because as you know, I think it was a trial by fire or, I think that was the model.\n\nTrial by fire. Like Yeah.\n\nYeah. Yeah. When you mentioned, like, just doing the most painful thing possible, like, every single day, and that's gonna, like, lead you to the most growth.\n\nAnd I was just doing that, like, cold calling all the time, just doing the most, you know, time to You'd boast of in the community, like, hey, guys.\n\nI did, like, two hundred cold calls today and booked, like, sixteen meetings. What was the most about how many meetings did you book in a day? I don't think it was as many as sixteen. How many did you book?\n\nLike Oh, I think I think it was, like, I think it's been, like, I think it was twelve or so.\n\nYeah. Fucking many. I've I've been that's the thing. It's it's weird, but I I I'm definitely trying to hit twenty meetings booked in a day. I know you guys are doing, like, crazy numbers.\n\nDude, we booked after the easy grow launch, we booked a hundred and thirty in one day. And now now we're we're fully booked across five reps for a week in advance.\n\nIt's crazy, man. But, anyways, this is about you. I am. But twenty meetings in a day. I mean, the fact that you did twelve in a day purely with cold calling because that was using the script from the program, wasn't it? But you sort of, like, took it and then you made it your own, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. But that was also a bit from, from cold email, because as you guys know, I I was the one who created, like, the the the automation of looms.\n\nAnd I Charlie created, like, the original Terminator looms, but I Dude, this guy is, like, a fucking automation genius, mate.\n\nYou created so much, like, hands off stuff, didn't you?\n\nYeah. Yeah. I I definitely did. But, yeah, I'm actually I'm gonna be dropping, a guide with that just for, like, the laptop version at least, because, like, the other ones were two screens. So, but, yeah, I'm just increasing now so I can only do do a laptop.\n\nBut, yeah, I can record, like What we'll do is Eric's actually got a YouTube channel where he does all of this cool automation stuff.\n\nI'll link that in the description.\n\nSo you can click the first thing in the description, and then then you go and check out, like, what Eric does because a lot of the stuff that he does is an extension of the program. But but listen, mate. I've actually gotta go to a team meeting, which I'm now ten minutes late for. So we unfortunately need to wrap up. But but in in summary, you know, anyone watching this, like, at the end of the day, we've got, you know, almost twenty of these interviews now, and I've got, like, another four or five scheduled to do.\n\nYou can see exactly Eric is a real human. I promise he's not AI generated. As handsome as he is, I don't know if you can make him a new computer. But, ultimately, you know, if you resonate with this and you're trying to go from, like, nothing and build something for yourself so that, ultimately, you can manifest your personal potential.\n\nIf you feel like you're worth more than the norm or media like, there's nothing wrong with that because People think that there's everything wrong with, like, thinking more than norm. Like, if you feel like Eric felt and you wanna do what Eric's done, then there's gonna be a link in the description you can click. Takes you through to a funnel. It's designed to get you to book a call, sell you something.\n\nI'm not gonna pretend it's a free training or something. But, ultimately, you know, click that link, book a call, and then you can end up on a client interview like Eric has in in five zero six months. But, Eric, mate, it's been a pleasure. Is there anything else you you wanna round off with, or, you know, do should we call it a data?\n\nHonestly, yeah. Probably good. But I I do recommend, like, when you do join, just not don't, like, ghost everyone, but just, like, go into, like, a a deep monk mode and just completely change your mindset and paradigms and essentially, like, life at the end of the day.\n\nYeah. Amazing. Mate, thank you so much. It's been a pleasure.\n\nYeah. Thank you so much, Charlie. Talk to you soon.

I'm smiling quite a lot here because I just finished a client interview with a client of mine, and I would also, at this point, call him a very good friend, Eric, who went from nothing, zero, absolutely nothing, right, all the way to thirty thousand dollars per month as a dropout with no previous sales experience, no previous service delivery experience, no previous appointment booking experience. The dude went from nothing to thirty grand a month, and now he basically just travels Greece and does whatever the hell he wants.\n\nThis video is basically me interviewing him to find out exactly what the hell went on, how he did it. And he sort of breaks down step by step how he worked with us and what he did to sort of do that. And there's all sorts of little gems throughout here, so you can go planning for gold as you go through this video. But I'm over the bloody moon, man.\n\nLike, Eric's put a lot of work in, and, I just had a really heartfelt chat with him after the interview. And I love my work, man. I love it so much. And that's all I really have to say for the introduction.\n\nSo I hope you find this video useful, and, if you did, then you can always do the whole liking thing. But either way, I'm gonna get into the interview now. I will see you in there. Alright.\n\nHey, everyone. How's it going? And welcome back to another client interview.\n\nI'm really excited today to be talking to Eric, who is a client of mine, but also a friend of mine at this point.\n\nEric has basically done what most people consider to be impossible, going from zero dollars a month to thirty thousand dollars per month as a complete beginner with a social media marketing agency in the space of five months. Now that's pretty impressive, so I wanted to bring Eric on and interview him. He's been going through our program, and I wanted to get to the bottom of how he's done, what he's done. So, Eric, why don't you just start by introducing yourself, maybe tell people who you are, what niche you're in, where you're from, and all all that good stuff.\n\nYeah. For sure. So, hello, everyone. I'm, Eric Tablas. I'm originally from Vancouver, but I kinda live up in Whistler and, just over in Canada.\n\nBut, but, yeah, I'm twenty years old. I'm, I at the time when I joined, it was, September first, and now it's, like, February at the time recording this. But, but, yeah, I, I was in, like, third year university.\n\nAnd, but, yeah, now I'm just, pretty much just, like, traveling in, in Europe with a few other guys in the space and, living the laptop lifestyle. It's it's super fun. And, yeah, I'm I'm in the I'm in the real estate niche. So yeah.\n\nAmazing. So we'll touch on the laptop lifestyle thing because I think a lot of people watching this interview, and a lot of people who consider buying our program and stuff, like, one of their ultimate goals is to have that location freedom.\n\nSo if I'm not mistaken, so five months ago when you were starting, you didn't have the ability to just jet off to Greece when you wanted to. That's that's something that's happened recently. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Pretty much. Where have you been?\n\nWhere are you going?\n\nI honestly don't know. We're kinda just just gallivanting around Europe right now, but we were just in just in Portugal now. I honestly have no idea where we're gonna go next. It's, pretty pretty spontaneous. But, yeah, like, when I was at least, like, when I was first starting out, like or just when I first joined the program, like, before that, I was just, yeah, just going to university.\n\nMy goal didn't really align with what what was gonna happen if I didn't make a change. Mhmm.\n\nBecause something over the summer kinda clicked where I was like, fuck. If I don't make a change, like, I'm actually gonna be working on this.\n\nWhat do you think that what do you think that thing was? Because because what what what I wanna do, and I'm sure everyone's curious to know, is, like, where you were before the program. Because we can look at where you are now and stuff, but I think tracking back the genesis of that sort of, like, click. Was it a conversation you had, or did you just sort of think, like, fuck. I'm gonna end up, like, with a life that I hate if I'm not careful. Like, what was the impression?\n\nYeah. I was like, well, yeah. Like, first of all, I probably wouldn't wouldn't have ever, like, let myself actually get into that situation with, like, the nine to five. But, like, the whole realization was it kinda just happened in, like, May.\n\nAnd I was like, fuck. Like, I I need to, like, change something. Yeah. But, yeah, I pretty much just, like I honestly just started watching YouTube videos, and then I just started binge watching, like, everything, like, the the client interviews. And I I pretty much just, like, made a plan that I was going to pretty much drop out or, like, just stop university Mhmm. And just start the program on September first.\n\nAnd then pretty much from there, it's, it's been quite the journey, and now we're, now we're here.\n\nSo Dude, it makes me so happy, man.\n\nSo so you were basically what what were you studying in university? Was it business or something like that?\n\nYeah. Business studies. Yeah. It was like consumer behavior. So they're kinda like psychology and marketing, but I can be honest.\n\nLike, I didn't learn anything. That's usually how it goes. Yeah. Like, the stuff that I'm learning with the program and just overall, like, on the Internet is Yeah.\n\nIt's like you can't even really compare it to what I was learning in university because it's so, like, outdated and just not, like, useful information that I was learning in, in uni.\n\nBut So I Oh, yeah. A lot of questions. So so when you're at university studying business because I dropped out of university as well, and we've had a lot of other clients drop out to start the program, do similar thing to you. Yeah. Did you have this feeling that, like, you didn't fit in?\n\nWhere, like, you sort of had a different mindset or a different way of seeing the world, and you were really ambitious, and everyone else was sort of just, like, not not blind, but everyone's felt like an NPC, and then you're there, like, actually Yeah.\n\nLike, what how did you feel about how did that happen for you, and what was that like?\n\nYeah. A hundred percent. Yeah. Like, when I was it it really hit me when I was in my, like it was like a personal finance, like, lecture.\n\nAnd, like, the professor was like, well, yeah. This is, like, what we're doing. We're pretty much just gonna be showing you guys, and you're pretty much going to university to get, like, you know, the best job out of university. Yeah.\n\nEveryone kind of agreed, and now it's just like Chat.\n\nSitting there, like, Hold on.\n\nSo, yeah, I I kinda just like and it just from now on, it's, like, such a disconnect from from pretty much, like, every night university. It's, I don't, like, feel the same anymore.\n\nSo Yeah.\n\nNo. I hear you're a different person, man. You've grown. So when when you so you dropped out of university and you formulate this plan, you you binge watch the content, watch client interviews.\n\nWhat was the initial goal? Like, did you did you wanna get to thirty grand a month straight away, or was it getting the first few clients? Like, what what was that sort of was it ten k a month? Like, what was the first goal you wanted to hit when you dropped out?\n\nHonestly, I was, like, pretty ambitious. Like, I was viewing ten k a month as, like, not the actual goal, but definitely, like, a a milestone I want to hit.\n\nLike Yep.\n\nI was definitely wanting to be hidden. I remember, like, just watching, Luca's interview just so many times. Like, we've been doing, like, ten to three weeks, and and now now I'm there.\n\nSo Yep.\n\nSo yeah. But I don't think there was, like, really a goal. It was more just, like, I wanted to get to a point where I didn't have to, like, work the nine to five and also just, like, make a a shit ton of money. But Yeah. But yeah.\n\nSo your your goal was less like, you sort of wanted to get ten grand a month, but for you, it was more about the sort of time freedom, location freedom, freedom of movement, like, just being able to go where you want, when you want, with who you want without having to ask to anyone.\n\nThat's sort of what the what the goal was.\n\nYeah. But now you've done it, man.\n\nThat's such a good that's such a good feeling, bro.\n\nIt is. Yeah. Like, the money was pretty much just like a it was, yeah, just like a vehicle to in order for me to, like, do whatever I want. And I also just, like, hate being restrained by anything. So, like, the money just pretty much allowed that to for me to, like, not being, restrained by anything. Because it's it's actually it's such a weird feeling because, you know, usually when you went traveling, like, in the past, were you in, like, university or, like, or, like, in high school? And, like, it was and you're always, like, thinking, like, oh, I gotta go back soon, and I gotta go back to, like, normal life.\n\nBut I I just, like, don't have go back, man.\n\nYou you just stay there forever.\n\nI've never been to it like that, actually. That's a good point. Yeah. It's, it's pretty good.\n\nSo let's get let's get to the the nuts and bolts, the parts that people are probably quite interested in, in terms of how you use the program to do it. So if I think it'd be helpful for everyone if you sort of mapped out, like, in what order did you consume the the the content? But more importantly, like, what actions did you take to get that result so quickly? Because a lot of our clients, it it could take them, like, it could take them a year to get to thirty grand a month.\n\nIt depends on, like, how quickly they do it, what their mindset's like. When everyone signs clients and everyone sort of breaks free, so to speak, but you've done it in a very fast period of time. And, you know, for full transparency with everyone watching this, like, Eric is an example of what you can achieve with the program, but it is an anomaly. You're you're an exception.\n\nYou know? To get from zero to thirty with no previous experiences is is is difficult to do as possible. But most people might, you know, in the in the first few months might get to, you know, eight grand a month, ten grand a month. So you've done it differently.\n\nSo Yeah. Walk everyone through sort of the linear steps that you took and how you use the program to to accomplish this result.\n\nYeah. So, like, I guess, like, starting off, it was pretty much me just making a plan to go into, like, a super, like, I guess, deep monk mode when it comes to things Mhmm. Start being, like, first pretty much. So I I moved up to, like, Worcester, which is, like, kinda two hours north of Vancouver and pretty much, like, it's a super small town, and I just have, like, a house up there. So I pretty much just I not, like, ghosted everyone, but I just pretty much just, like, delete all social media, didn't really talk to anyone, just pretty much just, like, wanted to transform, like, my mind into, like, a mental, like, metam almost.\n\nAnd then, yeah, from there, I pretty much just, first of all, just started watching the mindset. I was, like, completely, just completely blown away.\n\nGood. Yeah. That was self transcended.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was something I've, like, never seen before. So, yeah, I learned about, like, paradigms and all that stuff, and I just consistently was hitting so many paradigm shifts, like, over, like, the the past months, like, since joining. Mhmm. But, yeah, at least, like, for kind of what really moved the needle the needle was, like, probably the looms.\n\nI got to a point when I was I had, like, an insane booking rate. It's, like, about ten percent, That's great. Like That's great. Like nuts.\n\nSo, and then, yeah, pretty much also cold calling.\n\nThat helped a lot, and that was also, like right now, it's, like, one meeting booked out of every, like, ten dials, which is, like, insane as well.\n\nSo And this is in the real estate niche.\n\nRight?\n\nYeah. So, yeah, these numbers might be, you know, a bit, bit inflated compared to, you know, other niches, like the gym niche or whatever. But, but, yeah, like, pretty much, I just kept on staying consistent. And then I was, like, you know, doing some, like, thirty day free trials, at the start, and I was charging, like, super low, like, seven fifty setups.\n\nAnd then now I'm I'm doing, like, way higher ticket, like, four thousand to, like, five thousand setups and then just twenty five percent commission after that.\n\nSo How did you feel about the sales thing?\n\nBecause had you ever done a sales call in your life before starting your agency? No.\n\nI was like So you just just did the training, and you were like, yeah.\n\nGo on. I'll just give it a go.\n\nYeah. I, yeah, I honestly had, like I I had no idea what I was doing. I remember I was just, like, super nervous the first few times. But, honestly, you just gotta do what you gotta do. Like, I I was kinda just, like, seen as, like, a, I guess, like, learning experience. I wasn't at least for, like, the first few few sales calls, and I just got, you know, better and better from that.\n\nBut And you use the the script in the program to do the sales calls or did yeah.\n\nYeah. Hundred percent.\n\nWhat what about service delivery? Because, obviously, we do a lot of service delivery in the program. Did you use any of that stuff? Or because I I know that you're also mentored by by Ishmael, who's another one of our clients as as well. Did did he help you with the service delivery, or was that was it sort of split of both?\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Ishmael showed me his service delivery, but, I kind of I guess he kinda gave me the foundations, and you guys also gave me the foundations as well. Mhmm. And I kinda, like, built off from that. So I was I was, like, showing the, when I was doing when I do, like, sales calls, I show them, like, the the golden follow-up system.\n\nOh, yeah. That little that little shiny apple. Yeah. Just watch our eyebrows just lift. Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo I think that's like a I think that's a good sorry to interrupt.\n\nI think that's a good a good thing for people to know. From when you're doing sales calls, like, what what we've learned and what Eric just explained is, like, don't tell people, show them. So it's you can tell someone, like, hey. We've got a system to get people to show up.\n\nBut, like, if you can actually if you if you show it mapped out in a nice pretty Miro board and you explain, like, well, this is exactly how it works, like, that alone gives so much more strength than because I'm assuming you do you do a probably a similar thing with, like, your ads and your funnels and stuff and, like, you know, when you're when you're walking people through it. So that's important. So if if you don't mind me asking, Eric, what what's the best day you've had sales wise? So five months ago, you were a different person making no money, just dropped out of uni.\n\nFast forward five months, in the last month or two, what's the best day you've ever done, cash wise?\n\nYeah. So it was a six k day, but it was supposed to be, supposed to be a ten k day, but a deal just fell through. So, but, I mean, I should be hitting a ten k day, probably within the next, like, two weeks or so if, if, like, if I just signed two clients in a day, but at at five k. But but yeah.\n\nIt's like That's that's by the way, that's that's cash collected.\n\nRight? That's not like Yeah. Yeah. Retainers coming in in a few months. That's like upfront setup fees. Right?\n\nYeah. That's that's all setup fees.\n\nBecause if we're if we're talking, like, like, retainers or, like, commission, like, I guess, deals. Yeah. Those could be I could be getting paid up to, like, fifty k in, like, a year from from one line, from, like, commission. So, but, yeah, like, at least, like, for, like, setup fees is cash collected. And that's, like, pretty much that's, like, all profit as well. So Yeah.\n\nThat's the thing. Like, the margins are, like, super high in in agencies.\n\nSo So five months ago, zero dropout, had no clue what you were doing, but you went monk mode.\n\nYou come out of monk mode. You know, four months later, you go traveling. You're now doing thirty grand a month.\n\nHow how the fuck does it feel?\n\nLike, knowing that you've actually seen you you you sort of in your mind, you imagined a life you wanted to have, I. E. Financial freedom, location freedom, having enough money to basically say fuck you to everyone. Like, how the fuck does it feel? What's the what's the main emotion that you feel when it comes to the success you've achieved?\n\nOr is it not quite registered yet?\n\nYeah. It's, you know, it's it's it's definitely it feels like quite something, but it feels like it was just meant to be. Like, it feels like it was just supposed to happen. Mhmm.\n\nBecause yeah. It's it's it's such a good feeling, though, just knowing that I'm just making, like, so much, and I have to, like, work a nine to five ever pretty much. I could just, like, do whatever I want. I don't have anything restraining me, and it's, it's super nice.\n\nAnd I'm I'm, like, also just traveling with, like, such a good group of guys, and we're all doing, like, pretty similar numbers. So it's, it's super nice to kinda just, like, build off off each other and stuff. So Yeah. But, yeah, it's it's super nice.\n\nLike, going to the gym every day, just, you know, exploring Greece and Europe overall. So Mhmm. So yeah. But yeah.\n\nIt's I just have, like, such a good feeling every night knowing that I'm in this in this, like, parallel universe and not a different parallel universe, like, in, like, a nine to five. But then again, I probably wouldn't ever kinda, I guess, like, let myself be in that position.\n\nBut Yeah.\n\nWell, you do anything. You you do anything you could to escape it if you really wanted to. I think that's that's something that, you know I mean, you've probably put yourself through a lot of work. I mean, obviously, you know, you can you can look at the program and attribute, you know, our program at Easy Grow to your success, but I think that a lot of it comes down to you and how much you worked.\n\nYou know? So I think that's important. So Yeah. Here's a question. So what's next?\n\nLike, where where do you wanna scale to next? What's your because I'm assuming you're not well, I mean, you you could be. It'd be fine if you were, but I'm assuming you're not just gonna sit back and get comfortable on a sunbed. So what Oh, yeah. The what what's the next goal? What's the next level of universe you want to achieve?\n\nYeah. We're we're just getting just getting started here. So, yeah, I'm thinking of, like, definitely a hundred k a month.\n\nI'm not exactly sure what the time frame is that gonna be like, but if I, you know, could pull it off by the end of twenty twenty three, that'd be amazing. But it's it's gonna be hard to, I guess, stay consistent with that just like because as you know, like, when you scale, you run into, like, shit ton of problems.\n\nSo You're gonna face all sorts of shit you didn't know you needed to fix.\n\nI think Yeah. I've already been to yeah.\n\nI I think the natural progression is, like, I think the hardest and you can prop you'll probably find this the hardest is going from, like, zero to, like, ten or twenty. Because that's like you have to go from civilian to business owner, and that's really hard. But I think, like, I think where most people plateau is when they need to decentralize their business. So it's when they need to start hiring people and replacing themselves and building systems.\n\nThat's when they that's when it goes wrong. So I think it's possible. I mean, you're you're an easy grow, so you won't find it too hard. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Exactly. So Yeah.\n\nSo here's here's the question where I get you to essentially sell the program for me. But Oh, yeah.\n\nWell, I was talking to Eric at the start before before he started, and he said he wants as many people to buy as as possible. So so if you what would you say to someone who's watching this and wants to is thinking about, you know, booking call or investing in the program, like, who was in the same boat as you? Like, what would you say to them as a as a result? Like, would you yeah. I'll just leave that as an open ended question.\n\nI'm gonna say as, like, Luca said it, just, like, buy the fucking programs. Like but, yeah, that that is so how I frame it as, like, this program is essentially, like, a one way ticket from you to get to where I was to essentially just, like, freedom in all areas of your life, like location, time, and, like, financial freedom.\n\nYeah.\n\nI would just do it, but only do it if you're willing to put in the work and, like, actually, you wanna actually change your life.\n\nBecause if you're kinda, like, you know, half assing it, it I mean, it still works, but you're not gonna get the results as fast.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd it's not gonna be as, like, I guess, meaningful for you. So but, yeah, I would hundred percent join. It's, you know, amazing community. I've talked to, like, so many so many people in there.\n\nI'm already, like, you know, meeting up with, with a few guys in a few months. Like, also, like, you and just my, like, mentor, Ishmael, and a few other guys. I'm actually think I'm doing, like, a podcast with some of them. So, yeah, community is, like, amazing because that's the thing.\n\nLike, I was thinking about this. And if I didn't join, I don't know where I would be, but I probably wouldn't be in Greece right now. And I probably because that's the thing, like, about entrepreneurship is it's such a, like, lonely path.\n\nMhmm.\n\nAnd if you don't have a community to back you up, things get super lonely sometimes. So Yeah. If you're just always surrounding yourself with, you know, people very similar to you, just like even, like, just online in the community, you're gonna grow way faster and feel like, I guess, like, more fulfilled and just, like, connected because you can get it's like a super, super lonely path.\n\nThat's sort of how I see it is it's like it's kind of like if if you imagine that and this is gonna sound really sort of, like, philosophical and hippie stuff. But, like, if you imagine that success is, like, just a really, like is a really dark path. Like, you there's a long there's a path, but it's just pitch black. It's like the mentor is the person who holds the light at the end of the path and says, right.\n\nThis is the direction you go. But, like, if you try and walk that on your own, you're gonna get you're gonna go mad. So if you if you do it with, like, a bunch of people and and they're all walking to the same light, like, it's way it's way easier. Yeah.\n\nSo well, I I promise I'm not sure.\n\nSorry. Go ahead.\n\nI was gonna say I promise that your bit wasn't scripted. Oh, we've done it, mate. We've done the interrupt problem.\n\nI was gonna say I I promise that the bit where you just ran it on about how Gray is wasn't scripted just for for for.\n\nGuys.\n\nYeah. But you but you go on, mate. What were you gonna say? Oh, no.\n\nI was just saying, like, the the path of success, how you're saying, like, the, like, the dark, path, it's it's pretty much just like a shit ton of pain that's, like, loaded up, and you have to get through all that pain to, like Yeah. Get to that tunnel. Because as you know, I think it was a trial by fire or, I think that was the model.\n\nTrial by fire. Like Yeah.\n\nYeah. Yeah. When you mentioned, like, just doing the most painful thing possible, like, every single day, and that's gonna, like, lead you to the most growth.\n\nAnd I was just doing that, like, cold calling all the time, just doing the most, you know, time to You'd boast of in the community, like, hey, guys.\n\nI did, like, two hundred cold calls today and booked, like, sixteen meetings. What was the most about how many meetings did you book in a day? I don't think it was as many as sixteen. How many did you book?\n\nLike Oh, I think I think it was, like, I think it's been, like, I think it was twelve or so.\n\nYeah. Fucking many. I've I've been that's the thing. It's it's weird, but I I I'm definitely trying to hit twenty meetings booked in a day. I know you guys are doing, like, crazy numbers.\n\nDude, we booked after the easy grow launch, we booked a hundred and thirty in one day. And now now we're we're fully booked across five reps for a week in advance.\n\nIt's crazy, man. But, anyways, this is about you. I am. But twenty meetings in a day. I mean, the fact that you did twelve in a day purely with cold calling because that was using the script from the program, wasn't it? But you sort of, like, took it and then you made it your own, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. But that was also a bit from, from cold email, because as you guys know, I I was the one who created, like, the the the automation of looms.\n\nAnd I Charlie created, like, the original Terminator looms, but I Dude, this guy is, like, a fucking automation genius, mate.\n\nYou created so much, like, hands off stuff, didn't you?\n\nYeah. Yeah. I I definitely did. But, yeah, I'm actually I'm gonna be dropping, a guide with that just for, like, the laptop version at least, because, like, the other ones were two screens. So, but, yeah, I'm just increasing now so I can only do do a laptop.\n\nBut, yeah, I can record, like What we'll do is Eric's actually got a YouTube channel where he does all of this cool automation stuff.\n\nI'll link that in the description.\n\nSo you can click the first thing in the description, and then then you go and check out, like, what Eric does because a lot of the stuff that he does is an extension of the program. But but listen, mate. I've actually gotta go to a team meeting, which I'm now ten minutes late for. So we unfortunately need to wrap up. But but in in summary, you know, anyone watching this, like, at the end of the day, we've got, you know, almost twenty of these interviews now, and I've got, like, another four or five scheduled to do.\n\nYou can see exactly Eric is a real human. I promise he's not AI generated. As handsome as he is, I don't know if you can make him a new computer. But, ultimately, you know, if you resonate with this and you're trying to go from, like, nothing and build something for yourself so that, ultimately, you can manifest your personal potential.\n\nIf you feel like you're worth more than the norm or media like, there's nothing wrong with that because People think that there's everything wrong with, like, thinking more than norm. Like, if you feel like Eric felt and you wanna do what Eric's done, then there's gonna be a link in the description you can click. Takes you through to a funnel. It's designed to get you to book a call, sell you something.\n\nI'm not gonna pretend it's a free training or something. But, ultimately, you know, click that link, book a call, and then you can end up on a client interview like Eric has in in five zero six months. But, Eric, mate, it's been a pleasure. Is there anything else you you wanna round off with, or, you know, do should we call it a data?\n\nHonestly, yeah. Probably good. But I I do recommend, like, when you do join, just not don't, like, ghost everyone, but just, like, go into, like, a a deep monk mode and just completely change your mindset and paradigms and essentially, like, life at the end of the day.\n\nYeah. Amazing. Mate, thank you so much. It's been a pleasure.\n\nYeah. Thank you so much, Charlie. Talk to you soon. Bye."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"#1f3399","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}}, {});
