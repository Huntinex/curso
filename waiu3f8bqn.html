Hello to everyone that is, watching this interview. You're with Nour here. I help out with the operation side of Easy Grow. And today, I'm extremely excited, to do a client interview with one of our amazing, long standing clients, Cindy, who has achieved some incredible numbers in a very, very decent amount of time. So this is gonna be a really, really good one. Recommend watching it from start to finish.\n\nAnd, yeah, Cindy, why don't you, just introduce yourself, let the people know who you serve for your agency and for your coaching business, and, yeah, just tell them tell them, you know, what your, what your businesses revolve around.\n\nOkay. Sure. So I'm Cindy, and I'm from Sweden. So when I first started, I was, I had an agency that helped the meds boss basically just get more clients through Facebook ads as the normal SMMA agency.\n\nAnd so I joined Imperium a week ago, like, two years ago. And then about six months ago, I started a coaching business for only females, to start their own agency. So I just teach them how to do what what I did, basically.\n\nAmazing. And just to paint a picture in the, you know, viewers' minds, you know, how much were you making with the MedSpa agency before you actually joined and then after you joined? And then how much, you know, in those six months with the coaching business, how much did you make upon starting to where it is now?\n\nYeah. So when I started, joining you guys, I made one thousand one thousand dollars. And and then now I I'm making about forty k, a month and have a whole team who runs everything. So I work, like, around maybe two hours a day on that. And then my coaching business, I started six months ago. I went from zero, and this month, we're on track to make three hundred k.\n\nBoom. That's just even I'm still taking it in. That's not our fault. So, yeah, to those of you that are watching, again, just to clarify, you know, and just to, you know, repeat what Cindy said there, she joined, she joined specifically to, you know, start a normal SMMA in the MedSpa niche, and she managed to just scale up from one k to forty k per month to the point where it's now systemized. And after doing that, literally six months ago, she'd just started a brand new coaching business, specifically helping other females do what you've achieved, Cindy, and you managed to package that knowledge and go from straight from zero to set to making three hundred k, by the end of this month, which is incredible. So, yeah, this is a great interview because usually, a typical re typically revolves around one single business.\n\nYeah. But it's like it's like we got two separate interviews for your two separate business. You got a four k per month at MedSpice Agency, then you got a three hundred k per month, coaching business, which which is amazing. So, yeah, lots to take in.\n\nJust to sort of give the viewers a bit of a background, Cindy, what were you doing before, you jumped into, you know, business? You know? How was life like when before you joined the program? What did things look like?\n\nOh, I I was studying. I was studying college or university, and I was about to graduate. And then also, I worked as a part time barista.\n\nAnd, yeah, that's what I did before I started my SMMA.\n\nYep. Amazing.\n\nIt took you two years to go from Baristan to to all of this, which is which is amazing. I think university studies in the UK at least in the last three years.\n\nSo Yeah.\n\nTo you.\n\nSo, yeah, that that's amazing. And I'd love to get your thoughts, Cindy, I guess, on the program in general and how you personally just approached things, when you first joined, you know, for your agency as well as what you took away when you started the coaching business six months ago. It'd be great to hear your perspective.\n\nSo for the, agency, I I learned a lot, be mainly about how to actually get clients and high paying clients, but also think a bit bigger.\n\nThey then, like, not only Sweden, but also, like, reach out to clients in the US, like, straight away even though you don't have any experience at all. So I started reaching out to US, and now I only have US clients. Before, I was, like, working a lot with Swedish clients and UK clients. But, obviously, US has more money, so you can charge more. So yeah. So I used Charlize method to get more clients there, and I got, like, clients very fast with this method, especially the Loom, the Loom video strategy.\n\nSo I used that a lot with my NUC, and that's how I scaled. I only did the Loom Loom emails.\n\nI didn't I didn't really do any cold calls or DMs or anything like that. I mainly did Looms.\n\nSo that's how I scaled that. And then also, for the coaching business, I think what I got from Imperium or Easygo was mainly Shari's mindset about things.\n\nLike, instead of doing, like, outreach, collaboration, I just went straight with ads, and that's also how I scaled that so fast.\n\nYeah.\n\nAmazing. Amazing. And, yeah, the reason why you scaled so fast, I know for a fact viewers there'll be some viewers watching, right, where they're like, oh, Cindy went from zero to, you know Yeah. To make three hundred k per month in six months. I can do it. Yes. You need to understand that, you know, with Cindy, for example, she was focused on our agency for about, I think, almost a year and six months, right, Cindy, to get to it.\n\nLike, two years, three years.\n\nYeah.\n\nTo to get to it to a significant point where not only you got it to a great revenue point, but you got experience, market knowledge, and just industry knowledge around the SMMA space where you can be a coach, and you can just fast track your success on that side. So that's amazing. And I know you mentioned, you know, you managed to use the Loom strategy and, you know, fix the client acquisition side of things for your agency.\n\nPrior to joining, Cindy, was there anything, specific that you were struggling with and you didn't know, you know, how to do outside of client acquisition?\n\nA little bit was also about, actually delivering results, which I, yeah, I I got help with that, just, like, how to write good copies, how to think outside the box, and just how to innovate on things, like, how to stand out from the crowd because, obviously, these medspots and all these companies, they get thousands of emails and DMs every day. So, yeah, just how to stand out from your crowd, basically.\n\nAnd, yeah.\n\nAmazing. And with, like, the the MedSpa agency, how is, like, the team sort of structured now compared to when you first started it? Because I know, like you said, it's fully systemized now. I think she said two hours a day, then you focus on your coaching business, and you're growing that, which is incredible.\n\nIt'd be great to know how things look from an operational standpoint compared to where you began. What does the team look like, the different roles, and, essentially, how you deliver your service and all that good stuff.\n\nYeah. So yeah. So when I started, I did everything by myself. I worked, like, crazy hours just to, handle all the clients and because I got a lot of clients from like obviously did a strategy, but then yeah that was not very sustainable because I worked like crazy hours but then I and I had a couple of VAs that did, like, outreach for me and stuff like that, but then I found a business partner, in the US, so we partnered up.\n\nSo now we have a team of, like, ten VAs that handles all the, like, callers for our agencies. So we have, like, an in house call center, and, we have a manager that operates, like, basically the whole company. And we just, like, manage her and just tell her what what she's gonna do. And then we just jump on, like, one hour daily meetings, basically, just to make sure that everything is running smoothly.\n\nYeah. That's incredible. I think what a lot of people struggle with, and it'd be good for everyone to know this, Cindy, from your perspective is and I'm sure you've obviously experienced it. When you go past that ten k per month, Mark, like you said, you're doing everything yourself. You you feel like pulling your hair out and just, you know, falling apart. Right?\n\nHow did you make that shift into, you know, getting into position you are in right now? Like, how how what exact hires did you make, and what was, like, the step by step process, to eliminate yourself from the business and be able to only work on it for one to two hours a day. Because I think with some founders, they're they're just trapped in it for a very long time. So it'd be great to hear how you, you know, approach getting out of it.\n\nYeah. So when I got, like, ten clients and I was was making a bit more than ten k, obviously, I I was doing everything myself. I called all the leads. I was doing all the sales meeting. I was delivering all the results.\n\nBut then I was reflecting. I was okay. If I want to scale this past ten k, obviously, I cannot do everything by myself because, yeah, I was capped out about ten, twelve clients.\n\nAnd then yeah. Okay. Then I was just thinking, okay. What is the easiest thing to teach someone that I can, hand off so I don't have to do that, and what takes the most time? And that was calling my client's leads, like, to book their appointment for them because we do that as well for our clients.\n\nAnd, yes, and that's pretty easy to teach someone. You just give them a script, and then they make the calls all day, every day. So that helped a lot to free a lot of my time. And then instead of doing outreach, we switched to ads, so that we didn't have to do any outreach. The ads was running by themselves.\n\nAnd then, also, the operations side as well because, obviously, there's guys always gonna say something. They're gonna text you, and they I'll have my personal number. They've texted me in the middle of the night because they're in the US. I'm in Sweden. So their morning is, like, evening for me.\n\nSo I we had a we have a operation manager that handles all the communication on that.\n\nAnd, yeah, so I think that's the main things.\n\nYeah. Amazing. And with the with the MedSpa agency, obviously, it's at forty k per month right now. I'm curious.\n\nDo you wanna go beyond forty k per month, or do you wanna just scale up the coaching business purely? Because we're gonna get into, you know, what triggered you to start that shortly. But I'm just wondering about the MedSpa business right now. Are you looking to grow that further or just keep as it is?\n\nNo. So we're not looking to grow that further.\n\nSo we want to reach a hundred k, and then we're gonna sell it to That's amazing.\n\nBuilt to sell. Alright. Amazing. Great. You've got two different plants here that are growing very, very well. So, yeah, that's amazing stuff.\n\nNow I'm curious, Cindy. So, obviously, that's the MedSpa agency talking from one k to forty k per month, which is incredible. And now you're obviously building towards that a hundred k per month mark, which is fantastic.\n\nNow I'm curious, you know, six months ago, what triggered you to go, I'm gonna start my own coaching business. Because, you know, with the MedSpa side of things, usually, people just focus on one thing right and they just blow it up in a good way. They send it to the moon. But with you, you decided, this is going well, but I'm gonna start something else.\n\nIt'd be great to hear your perspective. You know? What made you, what made you start it? Because I know, again, we briefly spoke about it.\n\nI think this is something you're more passionate about, I guess, because you're helping people like yourself. Right?\n\nMhmm. Yeah. So, like, during my two years or three years in, like, in this industry, I've noticed, like because I've been in a lot of programs, and I noticed it's, like, ninety nine percent guys.\n\nSo I I saw that there's, like, a market there mainly also because, like, even though, like, all the coaches I've I've had, they're, like, very great, but they can still not relate sometimes, obviously, because of, like, I'm a female. And so some issues I have, I know that you guys you guys don't have those issues.\n\nSo and then I also thought that because I was able to scale my agency, and there's no reason why another girl cannot do that. And I know that a lot of girls, they are, like, stuck in a nine to five job. They don't know like, they want more in life. They want to travel. They want more freedom, but they don't know how to get there. So I just wanted to be able to help them and actually show them that there is another way than a normal nine to five.\n\nSo, yeah, that's why I started. And also, yeah, because I saw that there was a gap in the market there, for female entrepreneurs.\n\nYeah. Hundred percent. And and it's amazing. And, again, we spoke about this, you know, just before, you know, the course started recording it.\n\nWe were speaking about how the the industry, you know, in info products and, specifically, space in general, Cindy, when it comes to coaches, consultants, SMA, it is predominantly, you know, dominated by males. Right? I can't think of, from the top of my head, like a female other than yourself now. It's something similar.\n\nAnd, it's similar to, like, sales programs where I actually saw, you know, in a the separate sales program, they're introducing, like, a female division with a female expert now, and she's creating her own product. And, again, it's just people it's a lot more relatable, and it's very, very powerful. It's definitely an untapped market because, you know, for the viewers watching this, especially for, you know, I guess, for the female market, as you said, yes. They can relate to the male educators, and there's no reason for them to not succeed like you have.\n\nRight? But it's a lot more relatable when you see someone like yourself do it. Like, I gave the example to you, Cindy, where and it'll be good for the viewers to hear this. Right?\n\nI've got three younger sisters. So if I create a course and Cindy has her course and it's the same level, my three younger sisters, even though my they're my sisters and they're my blood, they're going with Cindy because they see another girl, another female absolutely crushing it, and it inspires them because they go, hey. That's someone like me, and, you know, I can do it as well. So, yeah, that's absolutely incredible.\n\nSo so when you when you actually started that, Cindy, when you got the motivation and you're like, yeah. My agency is in a good good spot right now. I'm not working as much, and, you know, I'm I'm really passionate about this.\n\nWalk me through, like, how you approached it. Like, from day one, what was the game plan? How did you attack it to go from zero to getting those first few clients and just scaling up in such a, you know, short space of time?\n\nYeah. So I I did actually get help to create, to help me structure a course, from my business partners.\n\nSo to help my case, so this is how you should structure a course, and then I just made, the modules, basically.\n\nAnd so I had the foundations there, and, obviously, because I know what it is required because I've done it myself. I know what they need to think and what they need to do. So I just created modules on that.\n\nAnd then, basically, I just started running ads, and that's literally the answer. I just started running ads. And because there was, it's an untapped market, I got so many, people wanted to join. And because it's a female community, they feel like, yeah, female empowerment. You know? Females support females.\n\nAnd, yeah, so that's basically the it's very easy answer there.\n\nYeah. Just just create the pro create the you make it sound so easy. Create the program.\n\nIt is easy.\n\nThat's they do it. It works. And, yeah, it's it's amazing because I think you're sort of, understanding yourself in a way because, like, the reason why this was so easy, right, is because you know exactly what to do. Like, you've built your own successful agency.\n\nYou know what makes it tick. Yeah. It's It's at forty k per month. You're speaking about scaling date to a hundred k per month, and you're practicing what you preach.\n\nAnd, again, we spoke about this where a lot of people want to teach things without having done it themselves. You know? And you've seen this, like, for example, with us, with Bo and Charlie, prior to actually, you know, just creating a coaching business, they had their own agency in the gym space, and they scaled that to a hundred k per month. That's why this coaching business works so well because they know the ins and outs of everything.\n\nYeah. A similar situation with you here. You scaled a successful agency. It's still going, and that's why your program that you teach people how to do it, it's no surprise that it's doing so so well because you you're actively in there.\n\nSo, yeah, really, really great stuff.\n\nHow many like, when you did start running ads, Cindy, like, I'm curious. How many clients did you start to sign up, like, within the first month, for example? Like, what was the growth like?\n\nI think, actually, I have no idea, but I think it was maybe, like, ten ten or fifteen maybe. And then we got, like, twenty and then thirty and then yeah. So it and now we're, like, more than two hundred sixty people. So Wow.\n\nYeah. There you go. It's just yeah. It has grown very, very fast.\n\nAmazing. And, obviously, with with your MedSpa agency, obviously, I'm assuming that's done, like, on a retainer model where people pay you monthly, for the service. With your with the coaching business now, how do you structure your payments? Is it just a one off fee for the program, or do you have something else in place?\n\nYeah. So for the agency, actually, we're doing something different there. So we're doing a pay per show model.\n\nGot you.\n\nSo we do a setup fee and a startup fee and then a paper show model. Before we did a retainer, but now we switch to this one.\n\nBut for the coaching, it's a onetime fee, and then they can obviously split that payment up if they don't have that all at once.\n\nAmazing. And I'm obviously involved in operations, so I'm always interested to see, like, the back end dynamics. So with the I know you got the med spa side of things all locked up, and it's good to the point where you work one to two hours a day. How does it look in the, coaching program? What does the team look like there? How did operations look?\n\nIt'd be great to know how it compares to, like, your agency.\n\nYeah. So with the coaching program, it's a bit different because, what is required to scale is mainly, like, salespeople.\n\nSo we have, three salespeople who take calls and appointment centers, and they obviously set the appointments for them. And then so I'm one of the so I am the main coach in the program, and then we have, like, one focusing on sales and one focusing on mindset.\n\nSo we have three coaching calls, a week, and then I answer, messages and stuff like that. So yeah. And now, obviously, I'm trying to always improve on the product, so that takes some time as well. But aside from that, it maybe takes, like, also, like, one or two hours a day. I think.\n\nI think it's it. So you got the.\n\nThat's what I work for that two hours a day. Then you got this is this business where you're working two hours a day. So, literally, you've achieved the four hour work day. So so congrats.\n\nBut, no, that's that's absolutely amazing. And, you know, with the with the coaching business, Cindy, when it was when you were when you launched it, were you doing the sales yourself, or did you hire reps? Right? So you were doing it yourself.\n\nRight?\n\nYeah. So I did everything myself, just so yeah. Because I'm like, I was the product, and I was selling because it I actually did start selling before I even had a product finished. Yep. So so yeah. So I I had to take everything myself because, yeah, I was selling something that didn't exist, basically.\n\nSo I had to And that's funny because that's literally what Bo and Charlie done for the first variation of, like, engineering program.\n\nI don't know if you remember. And it's what we tell, like, students as well when they're transitioning to info. They feel like they need this big, amazing, polished off product like Easy Grow or even yours when actually you can start by getting presales and having the basic fundamentals in place and just start developing it from there. And they just get a discounted price as a result. So, yeah, that's fantastic.\n\nAnd, you know, with your, I'm curious with the hiring of the sales rep, Cindy. So you are obviously handling sales yourself.\n\nWhat was the process like in finding the reps, and how is the training like? Did you train them up yourself, or did you have someone else do it?\n\nYeah. So I have a a business partners. So they're handling the sales, part of things. So that's also why I spend only one to two hours because they, they handle the sales the salespeople.\n\nYeah. Amazing.\n\nSuper, super stuff.\n\nYeah. That that's incredible. So now we've got these two separate businesses here. So MedSpa, as we already know, we're looking to send that to a hundred k per month. You obviously wanna build to build to sell, which is fantastic.\n\nFor the coaching business, however, you're set to make three hundred k at the end of this month. Right?\n\nWhere where do you wanna take that? Like like we spoke about, it's there's so much untapped potential. Right? I think you're and and I don't just say this because you're here, but, genuinely, we spoke off camera as well. I don't really see any other female specifically helping females. So, yeah, curious where you what your goals are with this and where you wanna take it next.\n\nYeah. So now we're scaling, obviously, around Scandinavia, but then the goal is to start, outside of Scandinavia as well just to take it as big as it can. I want to be the the best female coach in the world.\n\nSo Amazing.\n\nAmazing.\n\nThat's amazing. So, Cindy, you've obviously been, you know, on this journey, like, since joining the program. Like, we spoke, I think, just over two years now. And, obviously, before that, you were doing doing some time as well.\n\nAnd we're we're talking about the wins, which is fantastic. But I also just wanna highlight some of the struggles just to let viewers know. It's It's not as easy as, you know, we're making it up now. So it'd be great to hear, like, throughout your journey, even with the program, like, what challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?\n\nBecause, again, a lot of people, especially the younger generation, they see these videos on online on YouTube, and they assume, yep. Zero to ten k. No problems. I'm not gonna, you know, have any issues, but that's not true.\n\nSo it'd be good to hear from your perspective, you know, what problems you faced, from a business, but also a mental standpoint, and how you actually sort of overcame that so people can actually know the the journey in full detail.\n\nYeah. So as you said, there's a lot of people who see, like, like, testimonials and, like, videos and gurus that says, okay. Yeah. Zero to ten k is so easy. You can do it in three months. You know?\n\nAnd then they go into, like, programs and have that expectation for me, I did struggle a lot with my agency in the beginning. That's also why I did join, Charlie in the beginning because I I I think I had worked with my agency for, like, six months, and I made, like, one k, which is not what I expected either because I saw all these testimonials. They was gonna go so fast. And I thought I would be at ten k by by then, but I was at one k.\n\nSo, yeah, I had a lot of struggles with my mindset a lot, and that's what I noticed was the main reason why I was only at one k after six months.\n\nLike, my mindset and my expectations, just my view regarding business, but also my my view regarding, like, myself and, like, what I'm capable of, but also, like, life in general, like, my surroundings, like, who I surrounded myself with, what I put my energy on, and stuff like that. So yeah. I mean, it has been a lot of ups and downs, which is also a part of, entrepreneurship.\n\nLike, you're gonna have days where everything feel like shit and, like, nothing goes as planned. I have lost all my clients, and and and that's just a part of the journey.\n\nYep. Love that. Yeah. And it's important we highlight that because, you know, we're having a bit of fun here.\n\nWe're talking about two hour workdays or four hour workdays. Sorry. And people listen to that, especially the younger generation again because I always see it, and they go, oh, wow. I can do that.\n\nJust come in and just do two hours of work like Cindy and make it, like, success.\n\nYou need to understand to end those four hour workdays like Cindy has, you need you need to work those twelve hour days, fifteen hour days.\n\nYeah. I I did that. Yeah. I I worked till, like, three AM, like, a lot like, many, many days. Like, two hours, like, every day for, like, a year, basically.\n\nThere you go. Exactly that. And it is important people know that. And I'm gonna also add to that, Cindy. You probably worked those hours, and things still weren't working. Things were still breaking. Right?\n\nSo Exactly.\n\nLike, that's just to highlight the fact that, you know, success is in a straight line here. And, you know, you can have the best program in the world, but there's always gonna be challenges, which is normal. It's part part and parcel of the game. And if you just stay in it, you will eventually earn those four hour workdays.\n\nSo, again, I wanna reemphasize this where those of you watching this, we're having a great conversation. We're talking about the good side and all of that stuff. But, again, since Cindy's had those, you know, twelve not even twelve, fifteen hours a day every day, and still things weren't working. Yeah.\n\nShe she kept going.\n\nYes. And then just sending cold email outreach for, like, twelve hours straight, like, for, like, months and nothing happened.\n\nThat's it. That's it, man. I think I think every success story has has been there, Cindy, where it's like they have those extended periods where it's like they're putting in all the hours and nothing's working. You just you just go ahead and move that block, and that's exactly what you've done, which is fantastic. And I'm glad you bring up the topic of, you know, mindset, Cindy, because it's such an underlooked it's such an underlooked thing with all the students I speak to. And it's funny because all the successful students I speak to, you know, that that I've spoken to thus far, they say to me, yeah, Noord. You know what?\n\nIt took me too long before looking at the mindset modules, and that's when I saw success. I'm like, yeah. Should should have watched that ages ago. So people assume it's just business tactics and strategies to get you to where you need to be, which is true to some extent, but, actually, some of the problems that are holding you back are internal.\n\nIt's to do with your beliefs. It's to do with your self image, and it's to do with your mindset. And if you don't have that in place, no amount of business strategies and tactics are gonna help you. So I'm curious, Cindy, on your end.\n\nI know when you said you, you know, you joined, you struggled with mindset. If you can share some sort of examples of, I don't know, limiting beliefs that you had, for example, and what you specifically done to change your mindset, that would be great to get you to the position you are in now. Mhmm.\n\nYeah. So in the beginning, I I didn't focus on mindset at all. I was just doing the work, you know, sending emails. But then I was like, hey. Something is is not right because I do the work, but nothing happens. You know?\n\nBut then, I realized, okay. It it's a mindset thing as well. I was, like, working out of, like, fear and, like, lack of I I really need this to work. I was figuring it everyday. Like, I was kinda, like, desperate for things to work, instead of just, like, letting go and just believing, like, in the process and just, like, not be so desperate for, like, clients, desperate for money, and desperate for everything to work.\n\nI think so I just had, like, a more chilled outlook on business, not taking it too seriously, and just trust the process. And, yeah, just know that, okay. If I put in the work, I will, get whatever I want.\n\nYeah. Hundred percent. It's it's about what's it called focusing on the the process, not the outcome. As long as you're point getting the inputs in, the output, it would eventually come. And it's funny you say where it sounds like you sort of just disconnected from the pressure of succeeding.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd, you know, I think there there's a there's books that talk about that.\n\nThe most prominent one is, you know, the subtle art of not giving. Yeah.\n\nHe literally speaks about, you know, just let go. Like Yeah.\n\nThat's it.\n\nDon't don't worry about it. If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Just make sure you're doing the thing in question. And majority of the time, success comes when you're not significantly attached to it. Like, you become you almost become numb to the pain. Right?\n\nYeah. I know.\n\nYou spent so long being, you know, in pain. When you just don't care anymore, success just comes.\n\nYeah. And I also noticed this when I coach, my my girls as well, is that a lot of people, they do come in with the mindset of, okay. It both days gotta take go fast, but then, like, if it doesn't go fast, they just quit. But for me, like, there was not never an option to quit because I I knew, like, this is the only way. Like, there was no other way. So, yeah, I think that also helped me a lot.\n\nYeah. Love it. And, Cindy, I wanna, you know, stick to the topic of mindset here, because it is a super important one, as you like as you like fully aware. You know, how does the the the version one of Cindy, right, that entered the program as, struggling with the business? I know you said you were studying and working at as a barrister. Right? How does that version look compared to, like, the version two now?\n\nYou're in, like, this complete boss position where you got two thriving businesses. Right? Yeah. How does it compare with one another?\n\nLike, I know we spoke briefly about, you know, the mindset side of things, but is there any other identity shifts you had to make throughout these two years to really achieve, you know, what you got here?\n\nBecause I know for a fact that you're not the same Cindy compared to now. So yeah.\n\nYeah. I I think a lot is about, like, before when I thought things was uncomfortable, like, I didn't I didn't do them.\n\nBut now it's just if it's uncomfortable, okay. Let's go. Let's just do it. You know?\n\nAnd I think that's a big part as well because, obviously, when you start off, everything's gonna be uncomfortable. And then you try not to do them, but that's also how you're gonna go, the fastest as well. So I think that's, one of the main things, but also, like, self image. Like, before, I'd never thought that I would ever be a coach.\n\nAlso never thought that I would, like, teach other people. I'd never thought that I would have a Zoom call with, like, hundred other people, and I would be the one that was leading the meeting. Because, like, I'm I'm an introvert, and I don't like talking in front of people.\n\nBut yeah. But now I have, like, events. I'm gonna speak in front of everyone, and, like, I have Zoom calls every week. And so, yeah, I think I'll just everything change.\n\nAmazing. Amazing. Yeah. Super, super happy for you. And like I mentioned, like, the reason I wanted to just emphasize on that side of things is, like, the identity shift throughout your journey is so crucial.\n\nAnd what I always tend to see, is, you know, people will step into the business, and they think they can just remain the same. They can Yeah. Keep the same beliefs, you know, keep the same bad habits of waking up randomly, not exercising or diet, you know, phone when they go to bed or wake up first week. They think they can keep all of these things, even bad friendship groups who are bad for them.\n\nRight? And in their mind, they're stubborn, and they say, I'm still gonna succeed. And it's like, no. You're not.\n\nWe need to make a change here, and that's why the identity shift, and the mindset work is so, so crucial. And, yeah, it's it's amazing, Cindy, because, again, you've had to make that shift yourself, and, it's proof to work it's proof to work really, really well. So fantastic stuff.\n\nI'm I'm curious, Cindy. And, you know, this is something that, I ask other students as well. You know, when Charlie Charlie Charlie closed you when he was still taking sales calls himself, Obviously, one of the most common sales questions is, Cindy, how is it gonna affect your life if you get to x y zed, y were at the time? So that was two years ago. What I'm gonna do now is simply ask, Cindy, how has how has your life changed now that you've hit your goals?\n\nSo Yeah.\n\nPlease rely on me because it'd be fantastic to, you know, revisit this because I think people forget, answering that question. And when they hit what they wanted to hit, right Yeah. They they they don't look around and look how far they've come. So Yeah. You know, please let me know. How has life changed now?\n\nYeah. So that's actually a very, very good question. Because, like, when I did join and I had a call with Charlie, I think I said, like, oh, yeah. I want more freedom.\n\nI want to be able to travel wherever I want. I want to have like, I can just spend my time, do whatever I want, just work work two hours on the business, and now I'm actually doing that. And, actually, when I said that, I didn't believe it was gonna happen either. I just, you know, was dreaming.\n\nAnd that's also why it's also important to actually dream big because even though you don't believe it, like, it can happen.\n\nBut but yeah. So that was what I said back then. And now I have been traveling for, like, two years just traveling where I want.\n\nSo I have been able to do that. I was just like I just came back from Bali and Cape Town, and then I've been traveling a little bit around Europe as well.\n\nAnd now I moved to Stockholm, and I live in a nice apartment in the city. And, yeah, I only work around two or three hours, four hours with both businesses.\n\nAnd, yeah, I can basically decide if I want to work or if I don't want to work, and I have full control over my life, basically.\n\nThe yeah. People watching this interview, they probably think I'm some sort of psycho because I can't say anything. I think I've I've done this with all the interviews, but with this one, especially, because you're just you know, you're going through what you said to Charlie two years ago. Yeah.\n\nTypically, when students answer that, like you said, it feels so delusional. Right? Yeah. Like, man, what what am I talking about? I love I die for freedom, traveling.\n\nYeah. Working four hours at I'll I'll save the dream, but Yeah. I'm thinking, but, you know, you you stick with it. You still save the dream.\n\nYou still have it in your mind, and, you know, you stick with the work. And look. You've now literally got everything you actually asked for. Like, it's funny.\n\nWe were supposed to do do this interview, I think, two weeks ago, but you're in Bali. And I'm like, Cindy, it's it's way too.\n\nSo it's it's it's absolutely incredible. And, yeah, like, I I got to ask you, Cindy, because I know you just, you know, told me how life has changed, right, as a result of the success you've seen in the businesses. But how does it feel?\n\nLike, how does it have you taken time to actually sit down and just reflect on things and just process your feelings because Yeah.\n\nIt's such an incredible achievement to have those delusional dreams. Mhmm. Be scared of them.\n\nBut still still pursue them and now in a position where you fulfill them. So Yeah. You've lived you're living your dreams, but how does it actually feel?\n\nYeah. I actually looked at my journal, a couple days ago where I put, like, two years ago, yeah. I'm gonna have, my have a team in my agency. I only work two hours a day. And and then now it is actually happening, and I I forgot that I wrote about it. But then when I looked back, I saw that.\n\nBut, yeah, it it feels amazing. I feel so happy. I can I can also, that's also one thing about women? Like, obviously, we when we're on a period and stuff, it's nice to not be able to work.\n\nSo yeah. So that is very nice that I could take a full week and just, like, chill, not be able not have to do anything that I don't want to do.\n\nSo, yeah, honestly, it feels amazing.\n\nYes. There there you go. Yeah. I think that was, like, some of the parts where where where you mentioned where only females would understand.\n\nI don't I don't understand. And now now it makes perfect sense. So, yeah, that that's amazing, Sydney. Super, super happy for you.\n\nAnd, yeah, to to the people watching this, right, again, like, if you've got goals, aspirations, dreams, no matter how delusional it is, if it's something you want, just write it down and have it in your mind. It doesn't matter if you feel like an imposter, like Cindy, for example. Yeah. She she could she couldn't see herself coaching hundreds of people.\n\nYeah. You know, having a team. You said you're introverted, Cindy.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd she just said it's delusional. Like, it's not delusional. Sorry. But it felt far out.\n\nRight? So in a way, you did feel delusional writing that stuff. And but the fact that you wrote it down and you wanted it, it's so, so powerful. So to people watching this, when you want a goal, when you want something, just be honest.\n\nDon't be embarrassed about it. Like like, it's normal to feel embarrassed because you may feel you're so far away from it, but you can work towards it. And that's exactly what Cindy done here in two years. And it's funny you mentioned feeding sort of, you know, it's not gonna happen, Cindy.\n\nTwo years ago when you wrote it down, you're like, oh, I don't know if this will happen. It's, it's similar to what was said in in in that book Psycho Cybernetics. I'm not sure if you read it, but it's he speaks about your creative mechanism.\n\nSo when you have one goal in mind, just focus on that goal. Don't worry about the process.\n\nYeah. Exactly.\n\nDon't don't pay a single energy ounce whatever to the process. In the book, all he said was focus on the goal. That's it. I want you to have that goal in your mind forever, and you'll you'll naturally find a way. So I think that's what's up to you here as well. So that's absolutely incredible.\n\nAnd, you know, look, looking at how life looks now, Cindy, where you're in a position where you can travel the world, you've got a nice apartment, and all of this stuff, is there you know, you've got your you've got it to the point where you're living your dream life. Right? What's motivating you to just keep on going? Because now it's like, I've got my dream life.\n\nI've got what I journaled about. Right? You know, what else do you know, what money can only motivate me so much? So it'd be great to hear that side.\n\nI know you said you wanna be the number one female coach, so so I'm assuming that's the main thing. Right?\n\nYeah.\n\nYes. So, I mean, I think that, when you hit the goal, there's always, like, a next goal. You like, if you just because you cannot be complacent because then you're just gonna stay where you are. And I think that's with everyone.\n\nWhen you reach, for example, when you reach ten k, you're gonna be like, oh, that's it? And you want to reach something else. And I think that's where I'm at right now. I obviously want to be the number one female coach to help other women also, like, to show them that there is a way than a normal nine to five job.\n\nI want them to be able to, like, believe in themselves and know that, yeah, that they can basically live their dream life and actually achieve dreams that they don't think is possible.\n\nSo, yeah, that's what I want to do. And then I also want to, you know, be able to have, like, full financial freedom. You know? Just do whatever I want.\n\nYeah. I love it. To be honest, I think you're in that position now.\n\nYou you are doing my video to an extent, but no. Totally get that. And that's amazing, Cindy.\n\nSo, yeah, that's that's fantastic stuff. And, you know, with with where you with where what you've achieved and where you've come from and all that good stuff, Cindy, usually with these interviews, right, there's two people two groups of people that are watching these interviews. The first of which are existing students and the second of which are, you know, customers or not customers. Sorry.\n\nBut people who have yet to provide the program. Perhaps they're on the fence. For the first group, which consists of current students, right, that are in the program, They probably just joined, and they're going through it. And they're going through that period where they may be struggling just like you did.\n\nWhat would you say to them in terms for of tips to succeed? Because you've seen it all. You have a great point right now.\n\nYou know, what would the key pieces of advice be to them?\n\nJust do the work and trust the process. Like, I think that that's basically it. I know it's, like, a very simple answer, but that decision. Just just do it.\n\nJust do the work. And when you feel you're gonna have dips, when you are into those dips, just ask for help, and just keep on going. Because if you only see one goal, like, you're gonna achieve it. Like, there's no question, like, if you're not gonna achieve or not.\n\nBecause if you only see one goal, and that's the only outcome, then if you keep working and never giving up, then you're gonna reach it. It doesn't matter when, but you will reach it.\n\nAmazing. Amazing. And, yeah, it's all about just grinding through those painful Yeah. Like you did.\n\nSo, yeah, amazing. And it sounds so simple, right, by. And I think people overcomplicate it when they're looking for that secret magic pill when, actually, it's just hard work, persistence. You've got the proven road map here.\n\nYou just need to follow it and not not crumble whenever a challenge pops up. So, yeah, fantastic. And to the other group, Cindy, where, it's people that have yet to purchase the program. Right?\n\nMhmm. What would you say to those individuals that are probably on the fence about joining? This question is always funny to people because it's like you're speaking to your old self before you join the program. So it'd be great to hear your thoughts on what you'd say to them if they're thinking of joining.\n\nYeah. So if you're, like, stuck, right now with your business or you haven't started and you're looking for help, it is always better to find someone that's ahead of you that has, like, a road map to show you exactly what to do. Like, you can do it yourself, but it's gonna go so much faster if you have someone that actually guides you and you guys have coaching calls for everything as well. So, like, if they have any issues, they can just join the calls.\n\nAnd, yeah, like, if you want to reach your goal faster, just join.\n\nYes. That's it. And, yeah, that that perfectly puts in the end. One thing I'll add to that, and I always do this with my specific interviews now that I started doing them, is if you are someone that's looking for a magic pill where you want instant success and you think you can get Cindy's nodding the head to head.\n\nThat can happen. Yeah.\n\nThere you go. But you want instant success. You wanna get those four hour work weeks or like Cindy has, you know, in six months or something like that.\n\nI I don't know of a program that can help you do that, you know, in a matter of weeks, if even our own one. Okay? Like, I'm not gonna be delusional here. So if you're someone that wants the magic pill without doing any work, without facing any struggles, without having the identity shift, then this program probably isn't for you.\n\nYou know, this program will give you a proven road map as Cindy has seen, but it will still require work, assistance, and ultimately being open to failing forward. Okay? So if you're afraid of failing, if you don't want no problems in your life whatsoever, if you don't want no challenges, if you don't wanna change who you are, then, this program isn't for you. And if there is a program that does all of those things, then do let me know because if if you're able to find a magic pill that lets you achieve four hour work weeks in a week week in a few weeks like this.\n\nMe not too.\n\nThat's that's all, though. So yeah. But, no, in all seriousness, guys, if you're watching this and, you know, you're willing to work and you want a proven road map and you're willing to ultimately fail forward because that's part of succeeding, then, we can essentially help you do that. Okay?\n\nWe're not gonna promise you the world. We're not gonna promise you that there's not gonna be no struggles whatsoever because there is, as Cindy's described, there there are struggles. It's just part of the game. But with programs like ours, even with programs like yours, Cindy, by having that guidance, that mentorship, you can reduce the amount of problems that you face.\n\nAnd when the problems occur, you can actually have help. As Cindy mentioned before the program, when problems were occurring, she had no help. So she she did she didn't know where to go. So yeah.\n\nFantastic.\n\nAlright. That's really, really good stuff. And the final question I have, Cindy, is, obviously, for people watching, where can they find you?\n\nYeah. So you can find my Instagram. It's Cindy Leigh with two a's.\n\nCindy Leigh with two a's. And for the sake of simplicity as well, if you're watching on YouTube, that's gonna be in the description. So you can just click on the link and check out Cindy. And, yeah, just follow her as she's now got her four four hour workdays to make it even smaller, and then she scales up her two separate businesses. But, yeah, that's been amazing. Thank you so much for your time, Cindy. And to those of you that are watching this, I really hope you found this, interview valuable.\n\nAgain, it's it's a it's a fantastic example of you know, with Cindy's case, she built up her own marketing agency from one k to forty k per month, specifically in the MedSpa space. And once she managed to systemize that, she literally used the same principles and frameworks to build up her coaching, coaching business, which is now set to make three hundred k per month. So I think we said at the before the interview, Cindy, you pretty much entered the program making one k per month. Right? And now you're in the point in two months two years in where you're you're set to make three hundred and forty k per month.\n\nSo, yeah, that's amazing. So, yeah, if you guys are watching this, I hope you had a great one. Please do check out the other interviews, to hear other success stories and others and other, you know, people's perspective on the program. And, like I said, if you want a proven road map and system and you're willing to work and you're willing to ultimately fail forward, and get to your goals like Cindy has here, please do book a call with us to see if we could help. And, yeah, other than that, I'll catch you guys in the next one. Cheers.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/waiu3f8bqn?autoplay=0&wmode=transparent&wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

Hello to everyone that is, watching this interview. You're with Nour here. I help out with the operation side of Easy Grow. And today, I'm extremely excited, to do a client interview with one of our amazing, long standing clients, Cindy, who has achieved some incredible numbers in a very, very decent amount of time. So this is gonna be a really, really good one. Recommend watching it from start to finish.\n\nAnd, yeah, Cindy, why don't you, just introduce yourself, let the people know who you serve for your agency and for your coaching business, and, yeah, just tell them tell them, you know, what your, what your businesses revolve around.\n\nOkay. Sure. So I'm Cindy, and I'm from Sweden. So when I first started, I was, I had an agency that helped the meds boss basically just get more clients through Facebook ads as the normal SMMA agency.\n\nAnd so I joined Imperium a week ago, like, two years ago. And then about six months ago, I started a coaching business for only females, to start their own agency. So I just teach them how to do what what I did, basically.\n\nAmazing. And just to paint a picture in the, you know, viewers' minds, you know, how much were you making with the MedSpa agency before you actually joined and then after you joined? And then how much, you know, in those six months with the coaching business, how much did you make upon starting to where it is now?\n\nYeah. So when I started, joining you guys, I made one thousand one thousand dollars. And and then now I I'm making about forty k, a month and have a whole team who runs everything. So I work, like, around maybe two hours a day on that. And then my coaching business, I started six months ago. I went from zero, and this month, we're on track to make three hundred k.\n\nBoom. That's just even I'm still taking it in. That's not our fault. So, yeah, to those of you that are watching, again, just to clarify, you know, and just to, you know, repeat what Cindy said there, she joined, she joined specifically to, you know, start a normal SMMA in the MedSpa niche, and she managed to just scale up from one k to forty k per month to the point where it's now systemized. And after doing that, literally six months ago, she'd just started a brand new coaching business, specifically helping other females do what you've achieved, Cindy, and you managed to package that knowledge and go from straight from zero to set to making three hundred k, by the end of this month, which is incredible. So, yeah, this is a great interview because usually, a typical re typically revolves around one single business.\n\nYeah. But it's like it's like we got two separate interviews for your two separate business. You got a four k per month at MedSpice Agency, then you got a three hundred k per month, coaching business, which which is amazing. So, yeah, lots to take in.\n\nJust to sort of give the viewers a bit of a background, Cindy, what were you doing before, you jumped into, you know, business? You know? How was life like when before you joined the program? What did things look like?\n\nOh, I I was studying. I was studying college or university, and I was about to graduate. And then also, I worked as a part time barista.\n\nAnd, yeah, that's what I did before I started my SMMA.\n\nYep. Amazing.\n\nIt took you two years to go from Baristan to to all of this, which is which is amazing. I think university studies in the UK at least in the last three years.\n\nSo Yeah.\n\nTo you.\n\nSo, yeah, that that's amazing. And I'd love to get your thoughts, Cindy, I guess, on the program in general and how you personally just approached things, when you first joined, you know, for your agency as well as what you took away when you started the coaching business six months ago. It'd be great to hear your perspective.\n\nSo for the, agency, I I learned a lot, be mainly about how to actually get clients and high paying clients, but also think a bit bigger.\n\nThey then, like, not only Sweden, but also, like, reach out to clients in the US, like, straight away even though you don't have any experience at all. So I started reaching out to US, and now I only have US clients. Before, I was, like, working a lot with Swedish clients and UK clients. But, obviously, US has more money, so you can charge more. So yeah. So I used Charlize method to get more clients there, and I got, like, clients very fast with this method, especially the Loom, the Loom video strategy.\n\nSo I used that a lot with my NUC, and that's how I scaled. I only did the Loom Loom emails.\n\nI didn't I didn't really do any cold calls or DMs or anything like that. I mainly did Looms.\n\nSo that's how I scaled that. And then also, for the coaching business, I think what I got from Imperium or Easygo was mainly Shari's mindset about things.\n\nLike, instead of doing, like, outreach, collaboration, I just went straight with ads, and that's also how I scaled that so fast.\n\nYeah.\n\nAmazing. Amazing. And, yeah, the reason why you scaled so fast, I know for a fact viewers there'll be some viewers watching, right, where they're like, oh, Cindy went from zero to, you know Yeah. To make three hundred k per month in six months. I can do it. Yes. You need to understand that, you know, with Cindy, for example, she was focused on our agency for about, I think, almost a year and six months, right, Cindy, to get to it.\n\nLike, two years, three years.\n\nYeah.\n\nTo to get to it to a significant point where not only you got it to a great revenue point, but you got experience, market knowledge, and just industry knowledge around the SMMA space where you can be a coach, and you can just fast track your success on that side. So that's amazing. And I know you mentioned, you know, you managed to use the Loom strategy and, you know, fix the client acquisition side of things for your agency.\n\nPrior to joining, Cindy, was there anything, specific that you were struggling with and you didn't know, you know, how to do outside of client acquisition?\n\nA little bit was also about, actually delivering results, which I, yeah, I I got help with that, just, like, how to write good copies, how to think outside the box, and just how to innovate on things, like, how to stand out from the crowd because, obviously, these medspots and all these companies, they get thousands of emails and DMs every day. So, yeah, just how to stand out from your crowd, basically.\n\nAnd, yeah.\n\nAmazing. And with, like, the the MedSpa agency, how is, like, the team sort of structured now compared to when you first started it? Because I know, like you said, it's fully systemized now. I think she said two hours a day, then you focus on your coaching business, and you're growing that, which is incredible.\n\nIt'd be great to know how things look from an operational standpoint compared to where you began. What does the team look like, the different roles, and, essentially, how you deliver your service and all that good stuff.\n\nYeah. So yeah. So when I started, I did everything by myself. I worked, like, crazy hours just to, handle all the clients and because I got a lot of clients from like obviously did a strategy, but then yeah that was not very sustainable because I worked like crazy hours but then I and I had a couple of VAs that did, like, outreach for me and stuff like that, but then I found a business partner, in the US, so we partnered up.\n\nSo now we have a team of, like, ten VAs that handles all the, like, callers for our agencies. So we have, like, an in house call center, and, we have a manager that operates, like, basically the whole company. And we just, like, manage her and just tell her what what she's gonna do. And then we just jump on, like, one hour daily meetings, basically, just to make sure that everything is running smoothly.\n\nYeah. That's incredible. I think what a lot of people struggle with, and it'd be good for everyone to know this, Cindy, from your perspective is and I'm sure you've obviously experienced it. When you go past that ten k per month, Mark, like you said, you're doing everything yourself. You you feel like pulling your hair out and just, you know, falling apart. Right?\n\nHow did you make that shift into, you know, getting into position you are in right now? Like, how how what exact hires did you make, and what was, like, the step by step process, to eliminate yourself from the business and be able to only work on it for one to two hours a day. Because I think with some founders, they're they're just trapped in it for a very long time. So it'd be great to hear how you, you know, approach getting out of it.\n\nYeah. So when I got, like, ten clients and I was was making a bit more than ten k, obviously, I I was doing everything myself. I called all the leads. I was doing all the sales meeting. I was delivering all the results.\n\nBut then I was reflecting. I was okay. If I want to scale this past ten k, obviously, I cannot do everything by myself because, yeah, I was capped out about ten, twelve clients.\n\nAnd then yeah. Okay. Then I was just thinking, okay. What is the easiest thing to teach someone that I can, hand off so I don't have to do that, and what takes the most time? And that was calling my client's leads, like, to book their appointment for them because we do that as well for our clients.\n\nAnd, yes, and that's pretty easy to teach someone. You just give them a script, and then they make the calls all day, every day. So that helped a lot to free a lot of my time. And then instead of doing outreach, we switched to ads, so that we didn't have to do any outreach. The ads was running by themselves.\n\nAnd then, also, the operations side as well because, obviously, there's guys always gonna say something. They're gonna text you, and they I'll have my personal number. They've texted me in the middle of the night because they're in the US. I'm in Sweden. So their morning is, like, evening for me.\n\nSo I we had a we have a operation manager that handles all the communication on that.\n\nAnd, yeah, so I think that's the main things.\n\nYeah. Amazing. And with the with the MedSpa agency, obviously, it's at forty k per month right now. I'm curious.\n\nDo you wanna go beyond forty k per month, or do you wanna just scale up the coaching business purely? Because we're gonna get into, you know, what triggered you to start that shortly. But I'm just wondering about the MedSpa business right now. Are you looking to grow that further or just keep as it is?\n\nNo. So we're not looking to grow that further.\n\nSo we want to reach a hundred k, and then we're gonna sell it to That's amazing.\n\nBuilt to sell. Alright. Amazing. Great. You've got two different plants here that are growing very, very well. So, yeah, that's amazing stuff.\n\nNow I'm curious, Cindy. So, obviously, that's the MedSpa agency talking from one k to forty k per month, which is incredible. And now you're obviously building towards that a hundred k per month mark, which is fantastic.\n\nNow I'm curious, you know, six months ago, what triggered you to go, I'm gonna start my own coaching business. Because, you know, with the MedSpa side of things, usually, people just focus on one thing right and they just blow it up in a good way. They send it to the moon. But with you, you decided, this is going well, but I'm gonna start something else.\n\nIt'd be great to hear your perspective. You know? What made you, what made you start it? Because I know, again, we briefly spoke about it.\n\nI think this is something you're more passionate about, I guess, because you're helping people like yourself. Right?\n\nMhmm. Yeah. So, like, during my two years or three years in, like, in this industry, I've noticed, like because I've been in a lot of programs, and I noticed it's, like, ninety nine percent guys.\n\nSo I I saw that there's, like, a market there mainly also because, like, even though, like, all the coaches I've I've had, they're, like, very great, but they can still not relate sometimes, obviously, because of, like, I'm a female. And so some issues I have, I know that you guys you guys don't have those issues.\n\nSo and then I also thought that because I was able to scale my agency, and there's no reason why another girl cannot do that. And I know that a lot of girls, they are, like, stuck in a nine to five job. They don't know like, they want more in life. They want to travel. They want more freedom, but they don't know how to get there. So I just wanted to be able to help them and actually show them that there is another way than a normal nine to five.\n\nSo, yeah, that's why I started. And also, yeah, because I saw that there was a gap in the market there, for female entrepreneurs.\n\nYeah. Hundred percent. And and it's amazing. And, again, we spoke about this, you know, just before, you know, the course started recording it.\n\nWe were speaking about how the the industry, you know, in info products and, specifically, space in general, Cindy, when it comes to coaches, consultants, SMA, it is predominantly, you know, dominated by males. Right? I can't think of, from the top of my head, like a female other than yourself now. It's something similar.\n\nAnd, it's similar to, like, sales programs where I actually saw, you know, in a the separate sales program, they're introducing, like, a female division with a female expert now, and she's creating her own product. And, again, it's just people it's a lot more relatable, and it's very, very powerful. It's definitely an untapped market because, you know, for the viewers watching this, especially for, you know, I guess, for the female market, as you said, yes. They can relate to the male educators, and there's no reason for them to not succeed like you have.\n\nRight? But it's a lot more relatable when you see someone like yourself do it. Like, I gave the example to you, Cindy, where and it'll be good for the viewers to hear this. Right?\n\nI've got three younger sisters. So if I create a course and Cindy has her course and it's the same level, my three younger sisters, even though my they're my sisters and they're my blood, they're going with Cindy because they see another girl, another female absolutely crushing it, and it inspires them because they go, hey. That's someone like me, and, you know, I can do it as well. So, yeah, that's absolutely incredible.\n\nSo so when you when you actually started that, Cindy, when you got the motivation and you're like, yeah. My agency is in a good good spot right now. I'm not working as much, and, you know, I'm I'm really passionate about this.\n\nWalk me through, like, how you approached it. Like, from day one, what was the game plan? How did you attack it to go from zero to getting those first few clients and just scaling up in such a, you know, short space of time?\n\nYeah. So I I did actually get help to create, to help me structure a course, from my business partners.\n\nSo to help my case, so this is how you should structure a course, and then I just made, the modules, basically.\n\nAnd so I had the foundations there, and, obviously, because I know what it is required because I've done it myself. I know what they need to think and what they need to do. So I just created modules on that.\n\nAnd then, basically, I just started running ads, and that's literally the answer. I just started running ads. And because there was, it's an untapped market, I got so many, people wanted to join. And because it's a female community, they feel like, yeah, female empowerment. You know? Females support females.\n\nAnd, yeah, so that's basically the it's very easy answer there.\n\nYeah. Just just create the pro create the you make it sound so easy. Create the program.\n\nIt is easy.\n\nThat's they do it. It works. And, yeah, it's it's amazing because I think you're sort of, understanding yourself in a way because, like, the reason why this was so easy, right, is because you know exactly what to do. Like, you've built your own successful agency.\n\nYou know what makes it tick. Yeah. It's It's at forty k per month. You're speaking about scaling date to a hundred k per month, and you're practicing what you preach.\n\nAnd, again, we spoke about this where a lot of people want to teach things without having done it themselves. You know? And you've seen this, like, for example, with us, with Bo and Charlie, prior to actually, you know, just creating a coaching business, they had their own agency in the gym space, and they scaled that to a hundred k per month. That's why this coaching business works so well because they know the ins and outs of everything.\n\nYeah. A similar situation with you here. You scaled a successful agency. It's still going, and that's why your program that you teach people how to do it, it's no surprise that it's doing so so well because you you're actively in there.\n\nSo, yeah, really, really great stuff.\n\nHow many like, when you did start running ads, Cindy, like, I'm curious. How many clients did you start to sign up, like, within the first month, for example? Like, what was the growth like?\n\nI think, actually, I have no idea, but I think it was maybe, like, ten ten or fifteen maybe. And then we got, like, twenty and then thirty and then yeah. So it and now we're, like, more than two hundred sixty people. So Wow.\n\nYeah. There you go. It's just yeah. It has grown very, very fast.\n\nAmazing. And, obviously, with with your MedSpa agency, obviously, I'm assuming that's done, like, on a retainer model where people pay you monthly, for the service. With your with the coaching business now, how do you structure your payments? Is it just a one off fee for the program, or do you have something else in place?\n\nYeah. So for the agency, actually, we're doing something different there. So we're doing a pay per show model.\n\nGot you.\n\nSo we do a setup fee and a startup fee and then a paper show model. Before we did a retainer, but now we switch to this one.\n\nBut for the coaching, it's a onetime fee, and then they can obviously split that payment up if they don't have that all at once.\n\nAmazing. And I'm obviously involved in operations, so I'm always interested to see, like, the back end dynamics. So with the I know you got the med spa side of things all locked up, and it's good to the point where you work one to two hours a day. How does it look in the, coaching program? What does the team look like there? How did operations look?\n\nIt'd be great to know how it compares to, like, your agency.\n\nYeah. So with the coaching program, it's a bit different because, what is required to scale is mainly, like, salespeople.\n\nSo we have, three salespeople who take calls and appointment centers, and they obviously set the appointments for them. And then so I'm one of the so I am the main coach in the program, and then we have, like, one focusing on sales and one focusing on mindset.\n\nSo we have three coaching calls, a week, and then I answer, messages and stuff like that. So yeah. And now, obviously, I'm trying to always improve on the product, so that takes some time as well. But aside from that, it maybe takes, like, also, like, one or two hours a day. I think.\n\nI think it's it. So you got the.\n\nThat's what I work for that two hours a day. Then you got this is this business where you're working two hours a day. So, literally, you've achieved the four hour work day. So so congrats.\n\nBut, no, that's that's absolutely amazing. And, you know, with the with the coaching business, Cindy, when it was when you were when you launched it, were you doing the sales yourself, or did you hire reps? Right? So you were doing it yourself.\n\nRight?\n\nYeah. So I did everything myself, just so yeah. Because I'm like, I was the product, and I was selling because it I actually did start selling before I even had a product finished. Yep. So so yeah. So I I had to take everything myself because, yeah, I was selling something that didn't exist, basically.\n\nSo I had to And that's funny because that's literally what Bo and Charlie done for the first variation of, like, engineering program.\n\nI don't know if you remember. And it's what we tell, like, students as well when they're transitioning to info. They feel like they need this big, amazing, polished off product like Easy Grow or even yours when actually you can start by getting presales and having the basic fundamentals in place and just start developing it from there. And they just get a discounted price as a result. So, yeah, that's fantastic.\n\nAnd, you know, with your, I'm curious with the hiring of the sales rep, Cindy. So you are obviously handling sales yourself.\n\nWhat was the process like in finding the reps, and how is the training like? Did you train them up yourself, or did you have someone else do it?\n\nYeah. So I have a a business partners. So they're handling the sales, part of things. So that's also why I spend only one to two hours because they, they handle the sales the salespeople.\n\nYeah. Amazing.\n\nSuper, super stuff.\n\nYeah. That that's incredible. So now we've got these two separate businesses here. So MedSpa, as we already know, we're looking to send that to a hundred k per month. You obviously wanna build to build to sell, which is fantastic.\n\nFor the coaching business, however, you're set to make three hundred k at the end of this month. Right?\n\nWhere where do you wanna take that? Like like we spoke about, it's there's so much untapped potential. Right? I think you're and and I don't just say this because you're here, but, genuinely, we spoke off camera as well. I don't really see any other female specifically helping females. So, yeah, curious where you what your goals are with this and where you wanna take it next.\n\nYeah. So now we're scaling, obviously, around Scandinavia, but then the goal is to start, outside of Scandinavia as well just to take it as big as it can. I want to be the the best female coach in the world.\n\nSo Amazing.\n\nAmazing.\n\nThat's amazing. So, Cindy, you've obviously been, you know, on this journey, like, since joining the program. Like, we spoke, I think, just over two years now. And, obviously, before that, you were doing doing some time as well.\n\nAnd we're we're talking about the wins, which is fantastic. But I also just wanna highlight some of the struggles just to let viewers know. It's It's not as easy as, you know, we're making it up now. So it'd be great to hear, like, throughout your journey, even with the program, like, what challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?\n\nBecause, again, a lot of people, especially the younger generation, they see these videos on online on YouTube, and they assume, yep. Zero to ten k. No problems. I'm not gonna, you know, have any issues, but that's not true.\n\nSo it'd be good to hear from your perspective, you know, what problems you faced, from a business, but also a mental standpoint, and how you actually sort of overcame that so people can actually know the the journey in full detail.\n\nYeah. So as you said, there's a lot of people who see, like, like, testimonials and, like, videos and gurus that says, okay. Yeah. Zero to ten k is so easy. You can do it in three months. You know?\n\nAnd then they go into, like, programs and have that expectation for me, I did struggle a lot with my agency in the beginning. That's also why I did join, Charlie in the beginning because I I I think I had worked with my agency for, like, six months, and I made, like, one k, which is not what I expected either because I saw all these testimonials. They was gonna go so fast. And I thought I would be at ten k by by then, but I was at one k.\n\nSo, yeah, I had a lot of struggles with my mindset a lot, and that's what I noticed was the main reason why I was only at one k after six months.\n\nLike, my mindset and my expectations, just my view regarding business, but also my my view regarding, like, myself and, like, what I'm capable of, but also, like, life in general, like, my surroundings, like, who I surrounded myself with, what I put my energy on, and stuff like that. So yeah. I mean, it has been a lot of ups and downs, which is also a part of, entrepreneurship.\n\nLike, you're gonna have days where everything feel like shit and, like, nothing goes as planned. I have lost all my clients, and and and that's just a part of the journey.\n\nYep. Love that. Yeah. And it's important we highlight that because, you know, we're having a bit of fun here.\n\nWe're talking about two hour workdays or four hour workdays. Sorry. And people listen to that, especially the younger generation again because I always see it, and they go, oh, wow. I can do that.\n\nJust come in and just do two hours of work like Cindy and make it, like, success.\n\nYou need to understand to end those four hour workdays like Cindy has, you need you need to work those twelve hour days, fifteen hour days.\n\nYeah. I I did that. Yeah. I I worked till, like, three AM, like, a lot like, many, many days. Like, two hours, like, every day for, like, a year, basically.\n\nThere you go. Exactly that. And it is important people know that. And I'm gonna also add to that, Cindy. You probably worked those hours, and things still weren't working. Things were still breaking. Right?\n\nSo Exactly.\n\nLike, that's just to highlight the fact that, you know, success is in a straight line here. And, you know, you can have the best program in the world, but there's always gonna be challenges, which is normal. It's part part and parcel of the game. And if you just stay in it, you will eventually earn those four hour workdays.\n\nSo, again, I wanna reemphasize this where those of you watching this, we're having a great conversation. We're talking about the good side and all of that stuff. But, again, since Cindy's had those, you know, twelve not even twelve, fifteen hours a day every day, and still things weren't working. Yeah.\n\nShe she kept going.\n\nYes. And then just sending cold email outreach for, like, twelve hours straight, like, for, like, months and nothing happened.\n\nThat's it. That's it, man. I think I think every success story has has been there, Cindy, where it's like they have those extended periods where it's like they're putting in all the hours and nothing's working. You just you just go ahead and move that block, and that's exactly what you've done, which is fantastic. And I'm glad you bring up the topic of, you know, mindset, Cindy, because it's such an underlooked it's such an underlooked thing with all the students I speak to. And it's funny because all the successful students I speak to, you know, that that I've spoken to thus far, they say to me, yeah, Noord. You know what?\n\nIt took me too long before looking at the mindset modules, and that's when I saw success. I'm like, yeah. Should should have watched that ages ago. So people assume it's just business tactics and strategies to get you to where you need to be, which is true to some extent, but, actually, some of the problems that are holding you back are internal.\n\nIt's to do with your beliefs. It's to do with your self image, and it's to do with your mindset. And if you don't have that in place, no amount of business strategies and tactics are gonna help you. So I'm curious, Cindy, on your end.\n\nI know when you said you, you know, you joined, you struggled with mindset. If you can share some sort of examples of, I don't know, limiting beliefs that you had, for example, and what you specifically done to change your mindset, that would be great to get you to the position you are in now. Mhmm.\n\nYeah. So in the beginning, I I didn't focus on mindset at all. I was just doing the work, you know, sending emails. But then I was like, hey. Something is is not right because I do the work, but nothing happens. You know?\n\nBut then, I realized, okay. It it's a mindset thing as well. I was, like, working out of, like, fear and, like, lack of I I really need this to work. I was figuring it everyday. Like, I was kinda, like, desperate for things to work, instead of just, like, letting go and just believing, like, in the process and just, like, not be so desperate for, like, clients, desperate for money, and desperate for everything to work.\n\nI think so I just had, like, a more chilled outlook on business, not taking it too seriously, and just trust the process. And, yeah, just know that, okay. If I put in the work, I will, get whatever I want.\n\nYeah. Hundred percent. It's it's about what's it called focusing on the the process, not the outcome. As long as you're point getting the inputs in, the output, it would eventually come. And it's funny you say where it sounds like you sort of just disconnected from the pressure of succeeding.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd, you know, I think there there's a there's books that talk about that.\n\nThe most prominent one is, you know, the subtle art of not giving. Yeah.\n\nHe literally speaks about, you know, just let go. Like Yeah.\n\nThat's it.\n\nDon't don't worry about it. If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Just make sure you're doing the thing in question. And majority of the time, success comes when you're not significantly attached to it. Like, you become you almost become numb to the pain. Right?\n\nYeah. I know.\n\nYou spent so long being, you know, in pain. When you just don't care anymore, success just comes.\n\nYeah. And I also noticed this when I coach, my my girls as well, is that a lot of people, they do come in with the mindset of, okay. It both days gotta take go fast, but then, like, if it doesn't go fast, they just quit. But for me, like, there was not never an option to quit because I I knew, like, this is the only way. Like, there was no other way. So, yeah, I think that also helped me a lot.\n\nYeah. Love it. And, Cindy, I wanna, you know, stick to the topic of mindset here, because it is a super important one, as you like as you like fully aware. You know, how does the the the version one of Cindy, right, that entered the program as, struggling with the business? I know you said you were studying and working at as a barrister. Right? How does that version look compared to, like, the version two now?\n\nYou're in, like, this complete boss position where you got two thriving businesses. Right? Yeah. How does it compare with one another?\n\nLike, I know we spoke briefly about, you know, the mindset side of things, but is there any other identity shifts you had to make throughout these two years to really achieve, you know, what you got here?\n\nBecause I know for a fact that you're not the same Cindy compared to now. So yeah.\n\nYeah. I I think a lot is about, like, before when I thought things was uncomfortable, like, I didn't I didn't do them.\n\nBut now it's just if it's uncomfortable, okay. Let's go. Let's just do it. You know?\n\nAnd I think that's a big part as well because, obviously, when you start off, everything's gonna be uncomfortable. And then you try not to do them, but that's also how you're gonna go, the fastest as well. So I think that's, one of the main things, but also, like, self image. Like, before, I'd never thought that I would ever be a coach.\n\nAlso never thought that I would, like, teach other people. I'd never thought that I would have a Zoom call with, like, hundred other people, and I would be the one that was leading the meeting. Because, like, I'm I'm an introvert, and I don't like talking in front of people.\n\nBut yeah. But now I have, like, events. I'm gonna speak in front of everyone, and, like, I have Zoom calls every week. And so, yeah, I think I'll just everything change.\n\nAmazing. Amazing. Yeah. Super, super happy for you. And like I mentioned, like, the reason I wanted to just emphasize on that side of things is, like, the identity shift throughout your journey is so crucial.\n\nAnd what I always tend to see, is, you know, people will step into the business, and they think they can just remain the same. They can Yeah. Keep the same beliefs, you know, keep the same bad habits of waking up randomly, not exercising or diet, you know, phone when they go to bed or wake up first week. They think they can keep all of these things, even bad friendship groups who are bad for them.\n\nRight? And in their mind, they're stubborn, and they say, I'm still gonna succeed. And it's like, no. You're not.\n\nWe need to make a change here, and that's why the identity shift, and the mindset work is so, so crucial. And, yeah, it's it's amazing, Cindy, because, again, you've had to make that shift yourself, and, it's proof to work it's proof to work really, really well. So fantastic stuff.\n\nI'm I'm curious, Cindy. And, you know, this is something that, I ask other students as well. You know, when Charlie Charlie Charlie closed you when he was still taking sales calls himself, Obviously, one of the most common sales questions is, Cindy, how is it gonna affect your life if you get to x y zed, y were at the time? So that was two years ago. What I'm gonna do now is simply ask, Cindy, how has how has your life changed now that you've hit your goals?\n\nSo Yeah.\n\nPlease rely on me because it'd be fantastic to, you know, revisit this because I think people forget, answering that question. And when they hit what they wanted to hit, right Yeah. They they they don't look around and look how far they've come. So Yeah. You know, please let me know. How has life changed now?\n\nYeah. So that's actually a very, very good question. Because, like, when I did join and I had a call with Charlie, I think I said, like, oh, yeah. I want more freedom.\n\nI want to be able to travel wherever I want. I want to have like, I can just spend my time, do whatever I want, just work work two hours on the business, and now I'm actually doing that. And, actually, when I said that, I didn't believe it was gonna happen either. I just, you know, was dreaming.\n\nAnd that's also why it's also important to actually dream big because even though you don't believe it, like, it can happen.\n\nBut but yeah. So that was what I said back then. And now I have been traveling for, like, two years just traveling where I want.\n\nSo I have been able to do that. I was just like I just came back from Bali and Cape Town, and then I've been traveling a little bit around Europe as well.\n\nAnd now I moved to Stockholm, and I live in a nice apartment in the city. And, yeah, I only work around two or three hours, four hours with both businesses.\n\nAnd, yeah, I can basically decide if I want to work or if I don't want to work, and I have full control over my life, basically.\n\nThe yeah. People watching this interview, they probably think I'm some sort of psycho because I can't say anything. I think I've I've done this with all the interviews, but with this one, especially, because you're just you know, you're going through what you said to Charlie two years ago. Yeah.\n\nTypically, when students answer that, like you said, it feels so delusional. Right? Yeah. Like, man, what what am I talking about? I love I die for freedom, traveling.\n\nYeah. Working four hours at I'll I'll save the dream, but Yeah. I'm thinking, but, you know, you you stick with it. You still save the dream.\n\nYou still have it in your mind, and, you know, you stick with the work. And look. You've now literally got everything you actually asked for. Like, it's funny.\n\nWe were supposed to do do this interview, I think, two weeks ago, but you're in Bali. And I'm like, Cindy, it's it's way too.\n\nSo it's it's it's absolutely incredible. And, yeah, like, I I got to ask you, Cindy, because I know you just, you know, told me how life has changed, right, as a result of the success you've seen in the businesses. But how does it feel?\n\nLike, how does it have you taken time to actually sit down and just reflect on things and just process your feelings because Yeah.\n\nIt's such an incredible achievement to have those delusional dreams. Mhmm. Be scared of them.\n\nBut still still pursue them and now in a position where you fulfill them. So Yeah. You've lived you're living your dreams, but how does it actually feel?\n\nYeah. I actually looked at my journal, a couple days ago where I put, like, two years ago, yeah. I'm gonna have, my have a team in my agency. I only work two hours a day. And and then now it is actually happening, and I I forgot that I wrote about it. But then when I looked back, I saw that.\n\nBut, yeah, it it feels amazing. I feel so happy. I can I can also, that's also one thing about women? Like, obviously, we when we're on a period and stuff, it's nice to not be able to work.\n\nSo yeah. So that is very nice that I could take a full week and just, like, chill, not be able not have to do anything that I don't want to do.\n\nSo, yeah, honestly, it feels amazing.\n\nYes. There there you go. Yeah. I think that was, like, some of the parts where where where you mentioned where only females would understand.\n\nI don't I don't understand. And now now it makes perfect sense. So, yeah, that that's amazing, Sydney. Super, super happy for you.\n\nAnd, yeah, to to the people watching this, right, again, like, if you've got goals, aspirations, dreams, no matter how delusional it is, if it's something you want, just write it down and have it in your mind. It doesn't matter if you feel like an imposter, like Cindy, for example. Yeah. She she could she couldn't see herself coaching hundreds of people.\n\nYeah. You know, having a team. You said you're introverted, Cindy.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd she just said it's delusional. Like, it's not delusional. Sorry. But it felt far out.\n\nRight? So in a way, you did feel delusional writing that stuff. And but the fact that you wrote it down and you wanted it, it's so, so powerful. So to people watching this, when you want a goal, when you want something, just be honest.\n\nDon't be embarrassed about it. Like like, it's normal to feel embarrassed because you may feel you're so far away from it, but you can work towards it. And that's exactly what Cindy done here in two years. And it's funny you mentioned feeding sort of, you know, it's not gonna happen, Cindy.\n\nTwo years ago when you wrote it down, you're like, oh, I don't know if this will happen. It's, it's similar to what was said in in in that book Psycho Cybernetics. I'm not sure if you read it, but it's he speaks about your creative mechanism.\n\nSo when you have one goal in mind, just focus on that goal. Don't worry about the process.\n\nYeah. Exactly.\n\nDon't don't pay a single energy ounce whatever to the process. In the book, all he said was focus on the goal. That's it. I want you to have that goal in your mind forever, and you'll you'll naturally find a way. So I think that's what's up to you here as well. So that's absolutely incredible.\n\nAnd, you know, look, looking at how life looks now, Cindy, where you're in a position where you can travel the world, you've got a nice apartment, and all of this stuff, is there you know, you've got your you've got it to the point where you're living your dream life. Right? What's motivating you to just keep on going? Because now it's like, I've got my dream life.\n\nI've got what I journaled about. Right? You know, what else do you know, what money can only motivate me so much? So it'd be great to hear that side.\n\nI know you said you wanna be the number one female coach, so so I'm assuming that's the main thing. Right?\n\nYeah.\n\nYes. So, I mean, I think that, when you hit the goal, there's always, like, a next goal. You like, if you just because you cannot be complacent because then you're just gonna stay where you are. And I think that's with everyone.\n\nWhen you reach, for example, when you reach ten k, you're gonna be like, oh, that's it? And you want to reach something else. And I think that's where I'm at right now. I obviously want to be the number one female coach to help other women also, like, to show them that there is a way than a normal nine to five job.\n\nI want them to be able to, like, believe in themselves and know that, yeah, that they can basically live their dream life and actually achieve dreams that they don't think is possible.\n\nSo, yeah, that's what I want to do. And then I also want to, you know, be able to have, like, full financial freedom. You know? Just do whatever I want.\n\nYeah. I love it. To be honest, I think you're in that position now.\n\nYou you are doing my video to an extent, but no. Totally get that. And that's amazing, Cindy.\n\nSo, yeah, that's that's fantastic stuff. And, you know, with with where you with where what you've achieved and where you've come from and all that good stuff, Cindy, usually with these interviews, right, there's two people two groups of people that are watching these interviews. The first of which are existing students and the second of which are, you know, customers or not customers. Sorry.\n\nBut people who have yet to provide the program. Perhaps they're on the fence. For the first group, which consists of current students, right, that are in the program, They probably just joined, and they're going through it. And they're going through that period where they may be struggling just like you did.\n\nWhat would you say to them in terms for of tips to succeed? Because you've seen it all. You have a great point right now.\n\nYou know, what would the key pieces of advice be to them?\n\nJust do the work and trust the process. Like, I think that that's basically it. I know it's, like, a very simple answer, but that decision. Just just do it.\n\nJust do the work. And when you feel you're gonna have dips, when you are into those dips, just ask for help, and just keep on going. Because if you only see one goal, like, you're gonna achieve it. Like, there's no question, like, if you're not gonna achieve or not.\n\nBecause if you only see one goal, and that's the only outcome, then if you keep working and never giving up, then you're gonna reach it. It doesn't matter when, but you will reach it.\n\nAmazing. Amazing. And, yeah, it's all about just grinding through those painful Yeah. Like you did.\n\nSo, yeah, amazing. And it sounds so simple, right, by. And I think people overcomplicate it when they're looking for that secret magic pill when, actually, it's just hard work, persistence. You've got the proven road map here.\n\nYou just need to follow it and not not crumble whenever a challenge pops up. So, yeah, fantastic. And to the other group, Cindy, where, it's people that have yet to purchase the program. Right?\n\nMhmm. What would you say to those individuals that are probably on the fence about joining? This question is always funny to people because it's like you're speaking to your old self before you join the program. So it'd be great to hear your thoughts on what you'd say to them if they're thinking of joining.\n\nYeah. So if you're, like, stuck, right now with your business or you haven't started and you're looking for help, it is always better to find someone that's ahead of you that has, like, a road map to show you exactly what to do. Like, you can do it yourself, but it's gonna go so much faster if you have someone that actually guides you and you guys have coaching calls for everything as well. So, like, if they have any issues, they can just join the calls.\n\nAnd, yeah, like, if you want to reach your goal faster, just join.\n\nYes. That's it. And, yeah, that that perfectly puts in the end. One thing I'll add to that, and I always do this with my specific interviews now that I started doing them, is if you are someone that's looking for a magic pill where you want instant success and you think you can get Cindy's nodding the head to head.\n\nThat can happen. Yeah.\n\nThere you go. But you want instant success. You wanna get those four hour work weeks or like Cindy has, you know, in six months or something like that.\n\nI I don't know of a program that can help you do that, you know, in a matter of weeks, if even our own one. Okay? Like, I'm not gonna be delusional here. So if you're someone that wants the magic pill without doing any work, without facing any struggles, without having the identity shift, then this program probably isn't for you.\n\nYou know, this program will give you a proven road map as Cindy has seen, but it will still require work, assistance, and ultimately being open to failing forward. Okay? So if you're afraid of failing, if you don't want no problems in your life whatsoever, if you don't want no challenges, if you don't wanna change who you are, then, this program isn't for you. And if there is a program that does all of those things, then do let me know because if if you're able to find a magic pill that lets you achieve four hour work weeks in a week week in a few weeks like this.\n\nMe not too.\n\nThat's that's all, though. So yeah. But, no, in all seriousness, guys, if you're watching this and, you know, you're willing to work and you want a proven road map and you're willing to ultimately fail forward because that's part of succeeding, then, we can essentially help you do that. Okay?\n\nWe're not gonna promise you the world. We're not gonna promise you that there's not gonna be no struggles whatsoever because there is, as Cindy's described, there there are struggles. It's just part of the game. But with programs like ours, even with programs like yours, Cindy, by having that guidance, that mentorship, you can reduce the amount of problems that you face.\n\nAnd when the problems occur, you can actually have help. As Cindy mentioned before the program, when problems were occurring, she had no help. So she she did she didn't know where to go. So yeah.\n\nFantastic.\n\nAlright. That's really, really good stuff. And the final question I have, Cindy, is, obviously, for people watching, where can they find you?\n\nYeah. So you can find my Instagram. It's Cindy Leigh with two a's.\n\nCindy Leigh with two a's. And for the sake of simplicity as well, if you're watching on YouTube, that's gonna be in the description. So you can just click on the link and check out Cindy. And, yeah, just follow her as she's now got her four four hour workdays to make it even smaller, and then she scales up her two separate businesses. But, yeah, that's been amazing. Thank you so much for your time, Cindy. And to those of you that are watching this, I really hope you found this, interview valuable.\n\nAgain, it's it's a it's a fantastic example of you know, with Cindy's case, she built up her own marketing agency from one k to forty k per month, specifically in the MedSpa space. And once she managed to systemize that, she literally used the same principles and frameworks to build up her coaching, coaching business, which is now set to make three hundred k per month. So I think we said at the before the interview, Cindy, you pretty much entered the program making one k per month. Right? And now you're in the point in two months two years in where you're you're set to make three hundred and forty k per month.\n\nSo, yeah, that's amazing. So, yeah, if you guys are watching this, I hope you had a great one. Please do check out the other interviews, to hear other success stories and others and other, you know, people's perspective on the program. And, like I said, if you want a proven road map and system and you're willing to work and you're willing to ultimately fail forward, and get to your goals like Cindy has here, please do book a call with us to see if we could help. And, yeah, other than that, I'll catch you guys in the next one. Cheers."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"2949E5","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"2949E5","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}}, {});
